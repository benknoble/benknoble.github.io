> The limits of my language mean the limits of my world.
>
> —Ludwig Wittgenstein [1]

My life experiences have led me to conclude that everything we experience,
create, and do in our lives both produces, and is a product of, language. From
programming to playing an instrument, from math to martial arts, we simply
cannot escape the structure of languages, the specialized notations, the
all-senses-engaged nature of communication. Contrary to my introverted
tendencies, humans—myself included—rely on and thrive on communication. Below, I
explain how my conception of language as a unifying tool drives my desire to
participate in the B.S./M.S. combined program.

Just as vigorous writing is concise, so must vigorous programming be concise.
Strunk eloquently states that this does not require arcane, unreadable syntaxes;
rather, it requires that each language construct is adequately expressive, both
to reader and writer. I discovered my passion for concisely expressive
writing—code or otherwise— through many papers, through projects in Compilers,
and through my time on Piazza as both student and Learning Assistant. In
particular, this sort of construction relies on knowing the right language for
the (programming) job. For example, while I coordinate processes in shell, I
work with mathematical definitions in Scala, and I write a French paper in
French. For me, the essence of Cynbe's slogan for Mythryl is this passion: I
love the many programming languages, and I love to program languages.

How do we teach the "right words" of computer science (CS)? Talks by Colleen
Lewis, CS pedagogy researcher at Harvey Mudd College, led me to see the profound
need for more intuitive programming models. To close the gap between Twain's
"lightning" and "lightning-bug," between pointers and programs, between objects
and big-O notation, between functional programming and fun programming—this is
my goal as a future M.S. student and future educator (for any expert in a field
ultimately must educate in some form). Our languages must reflect our realities.

> A language that doesn't affect the way you think about programming is not worth knowing.
>
> —Alan Perlis [5]

The world needs capable CS experts to translate our domain language to a broader
context. Consider the Facebook scandals, exposing a need for the General Data
Protection Regulation and digital privacy. Or consider DeepFake, revealing a
need for trustworthy digital content policy. There is thus a need for
independent, unbiased experts who understand and translate these issues. How can
nations and peoples make good decisions without appropriate subject-matter
knowledge? David Auerbach, in his 2018 memoir *Bitwise: A Life in Code*, details
how the digital controls and classifies the human [6]. He claims that digital
algorithms over-simplify and over-categorize our behaviors while driving
behavior into the same categories. For our own sake, we must not over-simplify
the computer case, but we must ensure that those making decisions have the
appropriate information.

Ultimately, my passion is learning, evolving my language and expanding my limits
of the world. In doing so, I strive to become a guide and "poet" at the
intersection of bits and "thought-stuff," much as Fred Brooks, Jr. characterizes
the work of computer scientists [7]. I hope to contribute to programming
languages that guide us towards program correctness and expressiveness. I desire
to teach languages that guide developing scientists towards robust intuition and
understanding alongside inclusive and welcoming discourse. I aim to be a part of
an expert language and community that guides both my own decisions and those of
humankind, as we seek to re-examine ourselves in this digital age. I believe
that the B.S./M.S. combined program provides me the best opportunity for
education so that I may pursue these goals and best contribute to a broader
wealth of linguistic and scientific evolution.
