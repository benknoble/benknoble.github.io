  <p>Wizard: Er, 14?</p>

  <p>DM: You translate the book and it says…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We discuss how a skill check should really work in Dungeons and Dragons 5e.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-a-skill-check">What is a Skill Check?</h2>

<p>You might say, I know that one! I roll a d20, add my skill modifier from my
character sheet, and then the DM tells me I passed or failed! Mechanically,
yeah, that’s the basic idea of making a skill check. But you’re dead wrong when
it comes to <em>what</em> a skill check is.</p>

<h3 id="then-what-is-a-skill-check">Then what is a skill check?</h3>

<p>Well, let’s discuss what a skill check is supposed to do, and how we as good DMs
can accomplish that. Along the way we’ll create some simple guidelines for skill
checks.</p>

<p>A skill check is <em>not</em> just a mechanic to throw random number generators/dice
rolling at your players. And it is definitely not a “Do I know this random fact
about something” roll (we’ll get to knowledge checks later). A skill check is a
barrier, an obstacle that players  want to overcome. And all obstacles need
challenge, right? Otherwise, we’d just succeed at everything! Hm… I’m starting
to feel part of our definition coming on. My first instinct would be to say,
“All skill checks must involve a challenge,” but that’s a crappy definition.
Dice rolling isn’t a challenge, and it won’t feel very good for your players if
every time they attempt something they have to roll. Sometimes we need to move
the action along (you’ll note that the example at the beginning does nothing to
move the game forward). Which leads me to a better rule:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rule 1: If a player wants to act, and performing that action results in no
significant obstacle needing to be overcome (i.e., most people could readily
accomplish that action), then the player acts!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We’ll see how that changes later (e.g., most people can light a torch, but it
might be harder during the stress of battle). But you’ll notice that I’m giving
a lot of auto-success out now. Want to ask the King for money? Just ask (he
might just say no). Want to climb on that cart? Go for it! Want to do it unseen?
Well, now we have an interesting action. See, in the case of getting to the cart
unseen, we have some more interesting scenarios:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You get there, completely unseen</li>
  <li>You get there unseen, but lose something as a result (maybe you drops your
money bag or your rations)</li>
  <li>You get there almost unseen, but one perceptive guard notices and begins to
investigate</li>
  <li>You think you were incredibly sneaky, but you strolled up to the cart in broad
daylight and slowly climbed in. Everyone noticed, and now you’re in for it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that in none of the examples did I say, “You failed and were seen.” I gave it
more flavor, especially along the middle lines, where he partially succeeds.
This is something I borrow from reading DungeonWorld’s rules, but it can add to
the narrative drama of the game.</p>

<h3 id="actions-with-consequences">Actions with Consequences</h3>

<p>What’s different about this versus other actions? We have multiple resets! In a
binary system (ignoring the middle two bullets), we have “success” and
“failure.” And it’s up to the DM (us) to make success and failure <em>not</em> boring.
(That said, failure should still suck. That may be because it’s boring, but may
not.) I also managed to throw in some interesting halfway states. You might
creatively apply these if a skill check misses by just one or two points, or if
the character would normally be very good at this sort of thing and had a bad
roll.</p>

<p>But wait! I said skill check! I implied that this was a skill check, and it
<em>is</em>. For one simple reason: there are consequences that depend on how the task
is actually accomplished. Some are good, some cost you, and some really hurt (I
just wanted to hide in the cart…from the guards chasing me!). Is that a good
rule? Sure! It seems simple, and it needs to be: I don’t want to consciously
think about this too much. I have more important things to worry about. So,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rule 2: Only call for a skill check if there are consequences dependent on the
result.</p>

  <p>Rule 2 (optional rewording): Only call for a skill check if failure is
<em>meaningful</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We might call this something like “opportunity cost”—you failed, and because
you did that and not something else, this other thing happened. We don’t want to
make it too severe (nobody is losing limbs because they rolled a 1 diving into a
cart, at least not in my game), but we do want to allow the dice to actually
have some shape in the game.</p>

<p>Alright, sweet, so now we have two simple rules: most of the time, our players
just get to do things to keep the game moving. No bogging things down with “can
I lift this 50 lb weight” (if you have positive non-zero Strength, sure) or “can
I climb this ladder.” But, of course, climbing that ladder in time to stop the
BBEG from sacrificing poor Princess Zelda has a cost. Climbing the ladder
<em>sneakily</em> so the BBEGanon doesn’t hear the approach has a cost if unsuccessful.
Now what?</p>

<h3 id="skill-callouts">Skill Callouts</h3>

<p>We still have skills on our character sheets, and our players might ask “Can I
apply my stealth to climbing the ladder?” For some, that’s a valid question. Me,
though, it ruins my immersion, and it takes all the suspense out of the game.
So, here’s the solution: get rid of skills in dialog. Angry does this very well
in his article (see links at the bottom), so I’ll briefly explain the principle.</p>

<p>Nobody gets to talk about skills. You might describe your character as more
acrobatic, or tell me you want to persuade the king to give you more money, but
now we’re talking about in-game relationships, not meta-game stats. (There is
nothing wrong with meta-gaming, i.e. with players using available information to
inform their choices. This is just predictability!)</p>

<p>Done properly, this enables players to be more descriptive of their actions (and
DMs to do the same). Let’s look at the ladder again:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>RogueLink: So, hearing the sound of Zelda’s screams, I want to climb the ladder
quickly but stealthily. I coat my hands in cloth and take my boots off so they
make less noise.</p>

  <p>DM: Sure You leave your boots at the base of the ladder and wrap your hands in,
what, socks, or strips cut from you clothes? While you get ready for the climb
though, the screams get louder, and suddenly sound strangled [time keeps
moving…]</p>

  <p>RogueLink: I’ll go with the socks. Not much time, gotta get in there and rescue
her!</p>

  <p>DM: RogueLink, you make your way up the ladder incredibly fast, concentrated
very hard on not slipping because of your sock covered hand. Go ahead and make
a Stealth (DEX) check, with advantage for your precautions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now, at this point, I can have a serious, tense moment. The player rolls,
everyone waits to find out what is going on, does the rogue surprise the
BBEGanon, etc. If he succeeds, he has a serious leg up. If he fails, I have very
comic, very dastardly options. Maybe he slips and crashes to the floor, causing
Zelda to be moved somewhere else while Ganon searches for intruders. Maybe he
gets to the top, but bangs his head on the trapdoor because he was staring at
the ladder rungs. Maybe, if he barely makes it, he sneaks up the ladder, but
Zelda notices him and that gives Ganon a clue to turn around. Now the Rogue has
to make a choice about how to react: stand there, dart behind a column, dive
down the ladder, etc.</p>

<p>Our whole scenario got much more immersive. It also became more tense (though
the hilarity of Link facing Ganon without shoes is not lost in the ensuing
combat). We were focused on the game, not the mechanics of it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rule 3: Nobody can mention skills by name as skills.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Obviously, there’s some Grey area—a rogue might claim to be an expert at
picking locks, while a bard says, “I generally perform well” (in who-knows-what
context). But you can encourage players to be more descriptive. At least they’re
describing the game world and not sheets of paper.</p>

<h3 id="knowledge-checks">Knowledge Checks</h3>

<p>That pretty well covers it, right? Well except for maybe those pesky knowledge
checks. In 5e, we have things like “Arcana,” “Nature,” “History,” and
“Religion.” But some little die roll doesn’t influence what a character is
expected to know. We have three basic categories:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Common knowledge</li>
  <li>Common knowledge in a field of study (expert knowledge)</li>
  <li>Obscure knowledge</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="common-knowledge">Common Knowledge</h4>

<p>This is very straightforward: if your players <em>might</em> not know it, either
because they don’t remember what language the Ooks speak or because they haven’t
needed to yet, just tell them.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>DM: Guys, you see the Phoenix on the tavern door and know that it’s a safe
place for Order Members.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If I have them roll to find out if they know this, they’ll never figure anything
out about the world (because Goblin Dice and crappy luck and possessed RNG).</p>

<p>Besides, this is knowledge the <em>characters</em> should have.</p>

<h4 id="expert-knowledge">Expert Knowledge</h4>

<p>This is still pretty straightforward, at least to me. It’s knowledge that only
people with specific training would know. That sounds like proficiency to me. So
people that studied History or have knowledge of the Arcane might remember
details about the spellplague. A druid who knows Nature like the back of his
hand might be able to identify plants based on their smell.</p>

<p>So, if random squiggles on the ground are relgious purification circles, I tell
any player who has Religion proficiency that they  recognize them as
purification circles of ImportantGodPerson. I still have to tell people things,
but who knows what can be easily identified: people with matching proficiencies
<em>and</em> people whose background otherwise suggests they might know such a thing.
For example, a young Noble whose parents spent extravagant amounts to educate
him might know a lot about astronomy and geology (Nature-like things). If a
player can argue that their background or backstory gives them certain knowledge
(usually in less than a minute), I’ll give it to them.</p>

<h4 id="obscure-knowledge">Obscure Knowledge</h4>

<p>This is a bit more tricky. <em>Where</em> does that teleportation sigil lead? <em>What</em>
are the effects of this newly discovered plant? Now, you might think, skill
check! And I agree! This is the perfect opportunity for a knowledge-level
skill-check.</p>

<p>To get a leg-up, I’d say the players can</p>

<ul>
  <li>experiment and find out,</li>
  <li>go to a library/sage/herbalist and do research, or</li>
  <li>ignore it altogether.</li>
</ul>

<p>I still use proficiency/background to inform general knowledge (you know it’s a
teleportation sigil, just not where it leads) or to give instructive hints (you
read about bloodstained rattails in your training to become a priest, but you
don’t recall the details). But the players have to figure out how to figure out
the missing pieces.</p>

<p>If a spell affects your memory, I might ask for a check to recally very specific
facts. If there’s a definite, interesting cost to not knowing something, skill
check. If you’re attempting a precise ritual, such as creating a health potion,
praying for advice from a god, or studying intricate runes, <em>those</em> are good
times to let rolls happen. It’s a measure of attempting something challenging,
and lets people that are skilled at those challenges do what they do best.</p>

<h2 id="rules-recap">Rules Recap</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Most attempts to do things will just happen (auto-success).</li>
  <li>Only call for a skill check if failure is <em>meaningful</em>.</li>
  <li>Nobody mentions skills (or, alternatively, players only ask questions about
the world and narrate their actions).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="recap">Recap</h2>

<p>Keep the story moving!</p>
