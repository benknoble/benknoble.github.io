### The Site

[Junk Drawer][site] is hosted by [GitHub][github] Pages and powered by the
[Jekyll][jekyll] engine.

### Me

I'm David B. Knoble, an Honors Computer Science student at UNC Chapel Hill.

I rely on a healthy mix of self-taught experimentation and formal class training
for anything I do, including programming. My first experiences were been in C#
and Java, but recently I have discovered Scala, Vim, Bash, and Python. As time
continues, I gain exposure to other technologies, most recently including Go.

For some of the projects I'm working on, check out
[benknoble@GitHub][benknoble], or try my [showcase][showcase]. I'm also on
[StackOverflow][stack_overflow] and a few other StackExchange sites ([vim][vim]
anyone?).

### Junk Drawer

So, what is the "Junk Drawer"? Good question. In my everyday life, no matter
where I'm living or working, there's always a drawer or desk space or shelf or
shoe box where I throw flyers, books, notes, scribbles, and thoughts. It's a
catchall, and often times it gets quite cluttered.

This blog is dedicated to being a virtual representation of my junk drawers,
holding musings and notes from my life. Primarily, I will try to write about
programming, but I will frequently digress into other topics, such as math,
reading/writing, music, or D&D.

To see my virtual Junk Drawer on GitHub, visit [benknoble/JunkDrawer][junk].

Feel free to contact me with questions, corrections of misspelt words, or as a
matter of passing interest!
