# About

### The Site

Junk Drawer is hosted by <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> Pages and powered by the <a href= "http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> engine.

### Me

I'm David B. Knoble, an Honors Computer Science student at UNC Chapel Hill.

Most of my programming knowledge until now has been self-taught, with the beginning of my collegiate career finally formalizing what I already know about CS principles. My primary experiences have been in C# and Java, but recently I have discovered Scala, Vim, Bash, and Python.

For some of the projects I'm working on, check out <a href="https://github.com/benknoble">benknoble@GitHub</a>. I'm also on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/users/4400820/david-ben-knoble">StackOverflow</a> and a few other StackExchange sites.

### Junk Drawer

So, what is the "Junk Drawer"? Good question. In my everyday life, no matter where I'm living or working, there's always a drawer or desk space or shelf or shoe box where I throw flyers, books, notes, scribbles, and thoughts. It's a catchall, and often times it gets quite cluttered.

This blog is dedicated to being a virtual representation of my junk drawers, holding musings and notes from my life. Primarily, I will try to write about programming, but I will frequently digress into other topics, such as math, reading/writing, music, or D&D.
