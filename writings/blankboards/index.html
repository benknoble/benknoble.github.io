  <p>The original posting of this material (written by me, David Knoble) can be found
<a href="https://youthmissionco.org/blankboards/">here</a>. This is the unedited copy
submitted for that post.</p>

<hr />

<p>Imagine a whiteboard. A big one, extending far beyond the limits of your sight.
Just a big ole blank white board, waiting to be filled in. Zoom out, and see all
the whiteboards, exactly the same humongous size as the first, filling up space
in a grid of colored marker and explosions of thought on erasable canvas.
Whiteboards as far as you can see, with words and symbols and blobs, some with
moving pictures, others playing music, some connected by strings of yarn and
others covered in sticky notes. And one, off in a corner, blank. A marker sits
on the tray, uncapped. But nothing is drawn.</p>

<p>I won’t say I’m used to having all the answers (we all know how feisty faith can
be), but in school I can usually sit with a difficult question and find words
from a fleshy fold of brain matter somewhere in the cavern that is my skull and
speak to the question, providing some form of answer. Sometimes that looks like
a lot of external processing (read: talking to walls and other inanimate
objects); at others, it’s headphones in and jamming out. Sometimes showers,
sometimes bike rides, sometimes staring at pine cones, sometimes lightning-quick
flashes of inspiration in class. I’ve even written all over paper on the walls.
Even with the tough questions, my brain is running full-speed most of the time,
drawing strange connections and ready as often as possible to spit back an
answer half-formed of precise thought and half of blob-like shapes and colors.
As you can imagine, whiteboards fill up fast that way.</p>

<p>I thrive on extended metaphor. My favorite way to write is to take a metaphor
and meditate on it, pursuing the fleeting images wherever they might lead me,
capturing their essence in a free-flowing dialogue of pen and paper. The idea
leads me; I do not control it. I think this is why I see connections well, why I
see whole systems and individual moving parts, why a peculiar song lyric reminds
me of a movie which in turn draws me to a book or a story of my grandfather’s.
I’m willing to let things go where they will, to spread and adapt and change to
the day, the space, the mood. Rarely is there something that leaves me entirely
speechless, without existing connections to draw on or thoughts to explore. I
know I’m young, and there is certainly a lot out there that is unfamiliar to me
firsthand. But we understand the unknown via the known—we incorporate new
knowledge in the context of older experience. In other words, we as human beings
<em>connect</em>. Everything is a network of emotional memory and half-remembered facts
and midnight-snack-induced dreams.  So when something doesn’t immediately become
a new branch of my worldview, I am reminded of how much I don’t know and how
difficult some experiences can be to incorporate. And that can be breath-taking.</p>

<p>Imagine then, my spiritual journey in Raleigh this summer. I am confronted daily
(thanks to my boss, Katherine, our agencies, and our community members) with
issues that leave me at a loss for words, poetic or otherwise. Often, I am
simply pensive, leaving the office concerned that I am “broken.” I reflect and
wonder and wait and throw spaghetti-thoughts at the wall, and it seems like
nothing sticks. For someone generally ready to reply, someone like me, it can be
frustrating. At first, it’s just a reminder that I ought to pause before
responding and organize my thoughts. Then, it begins to feel like I’m searching
a haystack for a needle. And after a while, the void really starts to feel
empty, as words like “toxic masculinity” and “welcoming spaces” bounce around
without company in the walls of my skull. My whiteboards of ideas and thoughts
and connections have remained mysteriously, frustratingly, quietly blank. And
not for lack of trying—we are pushed constantly to reflect on difficult
experiences, to ask the hard, deep questions, to find words in the deep dark
void that we call ourselves. And sometimes all we can do is sit and say, “I
don’t know.”</p>

<p>Before this summer started, I would have said that it’s alright to admit to not
knowing, that I’ve done it before and that I was comfortable not having all the
answers. And on some level, that was true: I don’t mind not knowing what dinner
would be, what class would look like in a few months, or what life would bring
in just a few short, sweet years. But I never realized I wouldn’t be comfortable
drawing a blank when faced with tougher questions of who we are and who we are
called to be, of where I might be welcome and where I might not be, of just what
social justice issues might look like. I sit and sit and sit and wait, staring
at the inner-most recesses of my brain, repeating the words over and over to
myself, hoping desperately for a bolt of connection, for anything I can draw on
as background, for even a solar wind to stir the cosmic tides and shift my
perspective. And that lonely little whiteboard, it just sits with me. Waiting on
me to pick up the marker and write <em>something</em>. It sits, blank. And so I sit,
uncomfortable, pensive, deep in the trenches of my brain, but unable to fight
off the pressing silence of thought.</p>

<p>And pre-summer me is almost right: it <em>is</em> alright to not know. It’s needed and
necessary and important and <em>healthy</em>. When was the last time I really found
myself speechless before I started at RYM? When did I last find myself wrestling
with some big question and unable to formulate the beginning of a response? When
last did I sit, wordless in the face of the universe, struggling against silence
and open to the possibility that it is beyond me?  But I am not <em>comfortable</em>
with it—it is intentionally uncomfortable space, space in which we push
ourselves to the limits and find that, with all barriers removed, we don’t know
which direction to go in. That confusion, that lack of direction, <em>that</em> is our
struggle with the unknown, with the deeper questions of faith in a modern
setting. What are we going to do?</p>

<p>I reflect on our theme for the summer of 2017, and I am reminded that even as we
are looking at creating space in our communities, we should also look inwards.
We should explore how we create internal space to wrestle and struggle and be
<em>wrong</em>, how we can as a community open up that space to asking tough questions.
We should make sure that, amidst a sea of busy thought and faithful action, in a
storm of colors and blobs and sticky notes, we leave open in a corner a
whiteboard, blank. Empty. Silent.</p>
