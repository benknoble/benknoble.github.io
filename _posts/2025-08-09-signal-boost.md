- Colin Cornaby's [In the Future All Food Will Be Cooked in a Microwave, and if You Canâ€™t Deal With That Then You Need to Get Out of the Kitchen](https://www.colincornaby.me/2025/08/in-the-future-all-food-will-be-cooked-in-a-microwave-and-if-you-cant-deal-with-that-then-you-need-to-get-out-of-the-kitchen/)
