No, this isn't about my brief stint with archery.

You can find Quiver's site [here][quiver] and the app [here][itunes].

I "happened" across Quiver browsing the App Store, and after reading about it
decided to give it a shot. It is absolutely incredible. You can take notes in it
(and you're thinking, big woop) but it supports regular rich text, markdown (à
la StackOverflow or Github), LaTeX, almost every language of syntax
highlighting, and even fancy sequence diagrams.

And it get's better. The interface is remarkably easy to use--if you're a mouse
person, there's buttons and menus for everything, sure. But almost every
conceivable action has a keyboard shortcut, which means I can work *even*
faster. Further, it supports an edit/preview mode, wherein I can see what the
finished note looks like rendered. And because it saves data in JSON format, I
can use git for version controlling/backing up my [notebooks][notes]. You can
even export to HTML, PDF, and other formats.

One of my favorite features, though, is the __Vim__ editing mode. I've recently
started living in Vim for development work, learning slowly but steadily just
how powerful it is. Quiver supports both ACE (standard) and Vim keybindings,
allowing me to be almost as fast at taking and editing my notes as coding, and
more importantly to maintain a *consistent* typing interface. I say "almost,"
because the mode isn't perfect, but it's darned near close.

Expect to see more of my musings on Vim at a later date.

Finally, it is extremely configurable (notebook location, theme, default cell type,
the whole #!¹).

It has greatly improved my note-taking, especially in math and computer science
courses. It is designed for programmers, but use-able by anyone. Check it out if
you're a Mac user!

¹Sh-bang. Because ha**sh bang**.
