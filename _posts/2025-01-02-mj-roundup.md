Here's my reactions to a few articles from the January 2025 issue of [_Mother
Jones_ magazine](https://www.motherjones.com). The issue doesn't look linked
online yet; I read it through Apple News.

## "Settling the Score" by Emi Nietfeld

Nietfeld examines the contradictory popularity and flaws of Bessel van der
Kolk's _The Body Keeps the Score_. In particular, Nietfeld points out both the
mischaracterization of academic research (a gentle way to say "lies") and the
shaming of survivors broken bodies which, according to the text, may be
irreparable.

Nietfeld suggests alternative texts, which I want to collect here for my own
future reference:

- _Trauma & Recovery_ by Judith Herman
- _What My Bones Know_ by Stephanie Foo
- _The End of Trauma_ by George A. Bonanno

My own thoughts: trauma may (and probably does) live in the body, **and** CBT
(Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) is effective, **and** victims are not irreparably
damaged (healing is possible).

## "Hog Wild" by Miranda Lipton

According to Lipton's research, meat prices are up not (only) because of
inflation: Agri Stats effectively brokers data-sharing between competitors in a
way that creates price-fixing without the industry leaders' direct contact. The
DoJ sued in 2023 alleging violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act.

The arrangement is just like the [RealPage price-fixing for landlords to rig
rents](https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-realpage-algorithmic-pricing-scheme-harms-millions-american-renters),
which I think I first learned about from [Cory Doctorow's article on
surveillance
pricing](https://pluralistic.net/2024/07/24/gouging-the-all-seeing-eye/#i-spy).

Both Doctorow and Lipton connect the dots that centralized data sharing and
price "recommendations," combined with lax antitrust regulation due to Reagan
and Milton Friedman and with conglomerate mergers (4 companies control 85% of
the meat supply chain), leads inexorably to controlled cartel pricing.

Fortunately, the data sharing guidelines which permitted the old behavior were
rescinded in 2023, writes Lipton: so the DoJ can go after Agri Stats, too.

You might not know that this follows a familiar cycle: the Sherman Antitrust Act
dates to 1890. The Packers and Stockyards Act of 1921 prohibited unfair pricing
in meat-packing as a direct consequence of monopolistic behavior!

It's time to re-enforce existing laws. Loosening them 4 decades ago led to
predictable consequences.
