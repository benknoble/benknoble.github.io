Days 4 & 5 of the early-bird experiment.

Unfortunately, I was just so productive that I didn't have the time to write
these posts. Oh well.

This week, we're back to regularly scheduled programmingâ€”i.e., whenever I have
time to write and something to say.

I'll probably stick with the early wake-up time, though.
