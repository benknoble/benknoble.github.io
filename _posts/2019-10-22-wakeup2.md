Day 2 of the early-bird experiment.

## Day 2

Today's accomplishments:

- finished a textbook reading
- spent time on StackExchange
- browsed some code on GitHub
- checked emails
- uploaded a class recording to YouTube
- reviewed a newly-graded exam
- reviewed an assignment (and found a bug in it!)

And, of course, I wrote this post.
