While Ben has other articles planned for upcoming technical topics, we feel that
now, in the wake of the January 6th terrorist attack on the US Capitol by US
citizens, is a time for reflection on a scary political landscape and a time for
the explicit condemnation of white supremacy.

## On the attack

While there have been many actions in the last 4 years that threatened the
safety of Americans, this was the most personal for us. We don't wish to
invalidate the experiences of others.

Wednesday morning, we were shocked, scared, and frustrated by the breaking news
that Americans had breached the US Capitol, seat of the US government and symbol
of the shifting presidency.

While we acknowledge the extreme polarization of the United States, we never
imagined that a sitting President could actively incite such extreme violence.
Worse, before the 2020 election, we never believed that election results could
come under such intense and baseless accusations of fraud. We certainly never
imagined that such accusations (a) would come from the President and (b) would
lead to such unrest.

We feel called to actively condemn

- racism,
- white supremacy,
- violence, especially in the name of silencing others,
- ignorance of white privilege and autonomy,
- and the use of the presidential platform to spread misinformation and
encourage violence

## On the response to the attack

The response to this attack blatantly displayed the white privilege enjoyed by
rioters. The increased surge of [Black Lives
Matter](https://blacklivesmatter.com) protesters this summer saw the peace of
demonstrators meet with violent suppression from multiple parties, including the
police and extremists. In contrast, the response to what can only be called a
terrorist attack on January 6th overwhelmingly appears to lack appropriate
action. Whereas one group is met with unnecessary aggression, another is met
with none of the expected.

We are shocked and outraged by the response to this attack. We would regret any
loss of life for any reason, but we do believe in the responsibility of law
enforcement to secure the safety of our nation's government.

We cannot remain too surprised, however, for America as a nation has always
valued the lives of its white citizens over those of its
[people of color](https://www.nytimes.com/article/what-is-bipoc.html) counterparts.

## On our stance as privileged white citizens

We recognize that from the first our reactions are informed by our unique
cultural, social, political, and spatiotemporal identities. This necessarily
includes our whiteness. In even writing that this has been the "most personal"
feeling threat to us, we are forced to concede that many other events have
likely felt far more personal to those whom we wish to support.

We recognize that discussions of race often make white people uncomfortable;
this includes ourselves. We are actively working to normalize these
conversations between ourselves and within our friend groups. We believe that
this a way toward better communication and mutual trust.

Now more than ever, acting as a white ally for people of color requires actively
condemning attempts to silence their voices, suppress their rights, or subjugate
their bodies. It is not enough that we remain silent behind the front lines; nor
is it right that we speak for others. It is time to lift our voices in support
of theirs and to glorify their right to those voices.

We recognize that this requires much learning. Savannah, as a Sociology major
and Social & Economic Justice minor, and her many teachers, professors and
practitioners, are a testament to the wealth of resources available to educate
us. With that in mind, as we embark on a renewed journey of empathy and
understanding, we would like to leave a list of suggested books for the
interested.
