Ever `awk`â€™d a bunch of fields out of a pipeline? Tired of typing single quotes,
dollar signs, and prints, when you just want the fields? Me too.

See [GitHub](https://github.com/benknoble/Dotfiles/blob/master/links/bin/fields)
for the most up-to-date version, which currently supports specifying a field
separator and other Awk variables.

**Update 17th September 2019**: The `cut(1)` version only works if you use
*exactly* tabs between your fields. `awk(1)` is less picky about delimiters,
matching whitespace by default (and controllable with `FS` or `-F`). So, while
`awk(1)` is "reinventing the wheel" in one sense, I think it's really extending
it. Most command output that I care about does not use tabs, so `awk(1)` is more
robust than `cut(1)`.

**Update 15th September 2019**: Most of this can be done with `cut(1)` via the
`-f` flag. I might rewrite the script to take advantage of this, but preserve
the same functionality.

## Example

```bash
# ls -l | fields 1 9
total
-rw-r--r-- 404.md
-rw-r--r-- Gemfile
-rw-r--r-- Gemfile.lock
-rw-r--r-- LICENSE
-rw-r--r-- README.md
-rw-r--r-- Session.vim
-rw-r--r-- _config.yml

```

## How?

The script (below) is a wrapper around `awk(1)`: we just generated the code we
would normally type by hand, and feed it to `awk(1)`.

If you're concerned about timing to generate code, replacing `eval` with `echo`
and running `fields {1..100}` takes 0.012s on my machine. (If you're pulling out
100 fields, I have questions for youâ€¦)

I'm considering replacing `eval` with `exec`, but we will have to see.

## The script

```bash
#! /usr/bin/env bash

set -euo pipefail

log() {
  printf '%s\n' "$@"
} >&2

usage() {
  cat <<DOG
usage: $0 field...
DOG
}

die() {
  local ex="${1:-1}"
  exit "$ex"
}

usage_and_die() { usage && die; }

generate_awk_code() {
  local fields=("$@")
  case $# in
    0) return ;;
  esac
  printf "'{ print "
  # from the beginning to the second to last
  for field in "${fields[@]:0:${#fields[@]}-1}"; do
    printf '$%d, ' "$field"
  done
  # last
  printf '$%d' "${fields[${#fields[@]}-1]}"
  printf " }'"
}

main() {
  eval awk "$(generate_awk_code "$@")"
}

main "$@"
```
