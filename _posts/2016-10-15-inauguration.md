Today is the online Junk Drawer's birthday! Hooray!

<h2>Eagle Scout</h2>

Today is also the day I was officially deemed an Eagle Scout by the Boy Scouts of America. It was a long journey through years of scouting and an exciting project, but I got here.
I'd like to say a quick thank you to everyone that helped make that possible: Hal Groce, my parents, and SMPC. You guys helped me impact people.

More on the project in a future post!
