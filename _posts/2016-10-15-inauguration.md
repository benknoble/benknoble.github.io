## Eagle Scout

Today is also the day I was officially deemed an Eagle Scout by the Boy Scouts
of America. It was a long journey through years of scouting and an exciting
project, but I got here. I'd like to say a quick thank you to everyone that
helped make that possible: Hal Groce, my parents, and
[SMPC](http://www.smpchome.org). You all helped me impact people.

More on the project in a future [post][eagle]!
