I signed the [Resonant Computing Manifesto](https://resonantcomputing.org/)
today. I encourage you to consider your own core values and, if they align,
consider signing.

I'm [working on an essay]({% link _workshops/14th-racket-con.md %}) ("Why I
consider myself a modern Luddite"), and I've been thinking about [situated
software]({% link _posts/2025-04-18-skepticism.md %}#situated), the balance of
power, [LLMs as political
tool](https://www.noemamag.com/the-politics-of-superintelligence/), and trusting
fellow humans quite a bit. I find the manifesto a compelling tool for
establishing core values for software design. More to come…
