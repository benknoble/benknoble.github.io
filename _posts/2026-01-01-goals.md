Generally:
- actively look for local folks: meetups, community groups, unions, etc. (wiki: 2025)
- write more
    - Git: collected resources and my workflow
    - Critical thinking (wiki: critique/todo)
    - write about our experience reshaping our digital lives
    - share our general personal computing expertise/experience
    - start my book on GUI applications in Racket
- make time for board games (say, 1 big one per month? We play lots of little ones already)
- go to USK 2--3 times/week
- keep writing fun, useful programs.
    - think about where to direct open-source energy
- decrease household food waste

Areas I want to learn more about this year:
- Linux
    - Keyboard configuration
    - Productivity tools: controlling Firefox tabs, dunst/rofi/etc., manipulating my monitor's settings, …
    - Email client (aerc) for open source work
    - Setup LSP for ebuilds
    - Networking (wiki: linux-concepts/tcp; [Rootless pings](https://bou.ke/blog/rust-ping/) claims you need root for ping? FasterThanLime has a DIY ping series if memory serves)
- Alternative technology
    - [Euro Stack](https://euro-stack.com)
    - [sourcehut](https://sr.ht/)
    - Email server, domain, etc. (wiki: 2025)
    - VPN?
    - VPS or colocated hosting if needed?
    - Browsers (wiki: linux) if Firefox truly gets unbearable?

Political ways I can get involved:
- book access and general literacy
- digital/mathematical literacy
- LGBTQIA+ support
- local reporting
- digital control/privacy; personal computing
- de-toxifying masculinity
