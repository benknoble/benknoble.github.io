A short, probably sensible-only-to-me list of goals. Timeboxed. I'll also add
other things as I go.

Guiding principles:
- Meet good people. Do good work.
- Keep in touch with folks.
- Focus on a goal: file distractions away for later.

Timeboxed:

        - [x] Write about it (slightly late: travel + sickness)
    - [x] Paint regular Gamorrean Guards (slightly late: travel + sickness)
    - [x] Clean up notepad, notebook
    - [ ] Outline Luddite essay
    - [sent the final few versions](https://lore.kernel.org/git/cover.1767649692.git.ben.knoble+github@gmail.com/) of Julia Evans's documentation improvements for `git-reset(1)`
    - [submitted patch](https://bugs.gentoo.org/968366) for `equery(1)` manual

    - [ ] Paint remaining Weequay Pirates

- 2 months:

Generally:
- actively look for local folks: meetups, community groups, unions, etc. (wiki: 2025)
- write more
    - Git: collected resources and my workflow
    - Critical thinking (wiki: todo/critique)
    - write about our experience reshaping our digital lives
    - share our general personal computing expertise/experience
    - start my book on GUI applications in Racket
- make time for board games (say, 1 big one per month? We play lots of little ones already)
- go to USK 2--3 times/week
- keep writing fun, useful programs.
    - think about where to direct open-source energy
- decrease household food waste

Areas I want to learn more about this year:
- Linux
    - Keyboard configuration
    - Productivity tools: controlling Firefox tabs, dunst/rofi/etc., manipulating my monitor's settings, …
    - Email client (aerc) for open source work
    - Setup LSP for ebuilds
    - Networking (wiki: linux-concepts/tcp; [Rootless pings](https://bou.ke/blog/rust-ping/) claims you need root for ping? FasterThanLime has a DIY ping series if memory serves)
- Alternative technology
    - [Euro Stack](https://euro-stack.com)
    - [sourcehut](https://sr.ht/)
    - Email server, domain, etc. (wiki: 2025)
    - VPN?
    - VPS or colocated hosting if needed?
    - Browsers (wiki: linux) if Firefox truly gets unbearable?

Political ways I can get involved:
- book access and general literacy
- digital/mathematical literacy
- LGBTQIA+ support
- local reporting
- digital control/privacy; personal computing
- de-toxifying masculinity
