It turns out I might have only written this down once, so here it is.

The short version is I use Vim
- because it’s what I learned,
- because I don’t feel like porting everything to Lua[^1] and
- because, while I welcome Neovim’s excellent work making contributing to Vim
  easier, I have some issues with other parts of the community.

I find the (public, loud parts of the) Neovim community too willing to
reimplement existing plugins or features just to say it was done in Lua[^2], too
willing to hide complexity from novices in ways that make actually learning
Vim’s roots hard (let alone debugging complex framework code)[^3], and a bit too
“twitch gamer meme bro” for my personal tastes.

None of these things are bad; they don’t mesh with me.

In summary:

1. Neovim-the-tool doesn’t have a good value proposition for me as someone who
   knows Vim quite well and has a large Vimscript-based config that works for
   me.
2. Neovim-the-community has some great work yet still grates on me.

I continue to applaud their work to bring more people to the Vim ecosystem and
turn more people into contributors. I wish that community was more willing to
engage and collaborate with its sister, Vim.[^4]

## Notes

[^1]: Lua seems more verbose to do the same thing when scripting editing tasks…
    Vim's command language has a long history borne of editing powertools. Sure,
    its programmatic bits are odd, but you can learn those as you go and mostly
    by reading the manual (like any other tool).

[^2]: For just one example: why have
    [dracula.nvim](https://github.com/Mofiqul/dracula.nvim) when
    [dracula/vim](https://github.com/dracula/vim) has gone out of its way to be
    compatible with both editors? By all means, duplicate efforts… Or how about
    [fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive) somehow having to
    "compete" with [git-blame.nvim](https://github.com/f-person/git-blame.nvim)
    or [blame.nvim](https://github.com/FabijanZulj/blame.nvim)? I've started a
    whole conversation at work to try to understand
    [harpoon2](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/harpoon/tree/harpoon2) because it
    feels like "marks + [Tbone](https://github.com/tpope/vim-tbone) + pick your
    favorite way to spawn terminals"---in other words, learn the builtins first?

[^3]: Looking at you, [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org). I know Vim pretty
    well, and it took me several hours to figure out what you did to make my
    brother-in-law's Neovim open the Ex command line in a popup. Ugh.

[^4]: Christian Clason is the Neovim maintainer I most frequently see on the Vim
    mailing list, and I especially appreciate their efforts to stay in contact.
