title: 'Em-dashes are not spaced hyphens'

Please use an em-dash—like this one—for parenthetical asides or for a gentler
colon. <s>Do not use spaced hyphens - like this - they are wrong.</s>

I don't know where this trend came from or how to stop it. I suspect

- Poor education for effective punctuation and grammar means fewer people know
  about the [different kinds of
  dashes](https://practicaltypography.com/hyphens-and-dashes.html).
- Keyboard and editor interfaces hide away [various typographic
  characters](https://practicaltypography.com/type-composition.html), including
  en- and em- dashes, making them less discoverable.
- In the twist of self-reinforcing trends, publicly visible uses make this
  mistake more acceptable.

I can't top Butterick on explanations, so please review [Hyphens and
Dashes](https://practicaltypography.com/hyphens-and-dashes.html) for the
different kinds and uses. I'm going to mention some input methods he omitted:

- On an iPhone keyboard, holding the hyphen gives you options for dashes of
  different lengths, including en- and em- dashes.
- (Programmers) In
  [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/markdown/#kramdown)- or
  [Kramdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/syntax.html#typographic-symbols)-
  processed Markdown, the code `---` becomes an em-dash and `--` becomes an
  en-dash, thanks to [Typewriter
  Habits](https://practicaltypography.com/typewriter-habits.html). Note that
  they must appear within text not to be confused with the horizontal rule
  shorthand.
- (Programmers) In Vim, the digraphs `-N` and `-M` (enter with
  <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>k</kbd>) produce en- and em- dashes, respectively.

## Collected examples

I accept submissions.

- A [Foreteller Companion App post](https://web.archive.org/web/20240530222028/https://fortellergames.com/blogs/news/short-and-long-term-app-plans) reads:

    > - Growing concerns on regulations and legal ramifications - which trickle down into new policies to adhere to and shorter deadlines to implement, which puts our product development on hold
    > - App Store presence doesn’t help our niche audience - while ASO is important in most industries, we have qualitative data that shows overwhelmingly our installs come from direct installs from links, QRs, conventions
