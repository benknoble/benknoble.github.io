I spent part of my Junior and most of my Senior year working with Lee Bierer,
columnist and independent college counselor at [CAS][cas]. After my first
semester, she interviewed me about my experiences in college and published the
results.

_Update 2024 August 18th_: the original articles have disappeared and were
apparently not archived by the wayback machine. I found Part 1 on [College
Admissions
Strategies](https://collegeadmissionsstrategies.com/chapel-hill-freshman-reflects-back-first-semester/),
and [Part 2 as
well](https://collegeadmissionsstrategies.com/freshman-survival-secrets-part-2/).

To avoid future link rot, I'm hosting the article contents here, too. They were
written by Lee Bierer.

## Part 1: A Chapel Hill freshman reflects back on his first semester

I thought it would be helpful to hear directly from a first-year (freshman)
student about their first semester survival secrets. Ben Knoble, a 2016 Ardrey
Kell High School graduate, was back home in Charlotte for the holidays after
spending his first semester at UNC Chapel Hill.

Here are his responses to questions I thought would be helpful for college-bound
families:

1. What has made your first semester successful?

   > Finding my niches and sticking with them helped me build several groups of
   > close friends with similar interests, and it is precisely those friend
   > groups that will help and support you when things go awry.

1. How important has your housing and roommate situation been in determining
   your overall happiness?

   > My roommate and I are both very relaxed people, which has made living
   > together very easy. We don’t worry much about anything, and keep the room a
   > quiet space to relax when needed. For me, where I live is less important
   > than who I live with, and I have been very fortunate to live with a group
   > of like-minded, passionate students. We all have different interests and
   > personalities, but we work hard and play hard together.

1. How was your transition academically? Was it easier or harder than you thought?

   > Even though I was a high-performing student in high school, I decided to
   > take an easy first semester, sticking to classes I knew I would enjoy and
   > ones where I knew I would succeed. Not worrying as much about academics
   > gave me the freedom to build a friend group and explore other activities
   > that interested me. I also made sure to plan for breaks during the day.
   > All of this made the academic transition very smooth. Now that I’m
   > comfortable, I feel ready to tackle a more challenging semester.

1. Do you have any tips for high school seniors as they evaluate where to go to college next year?

   > Pick a place you’ll walk around smiling. That extra bit of happiness counts
   > more than academics or social life. If you don’t enjoy looking at the
   > campus for a day or two, you won’t enjoy it for four years. Remember that
   > college is very much what you make of it: pick a place where you can make
   > what you want.

1. UNC wasn’t necessarily your first choice school, how did you handle making it work?

   > Personally, I just kept faith that I was going to end up where I was
   > supposed to, and I truly think I did. It might not be where I had initially
   > wanted to go, but it’s where I needed to. Don’t mourn the things you’re
   > missing at the other school; look for ways to enjoy the incredible
   > opportunity you’ve been given.

1. Have you enjoyed your classes first semester?

   > Yes. The professors have incredible personalities, the content is amazing,
   > and a little bit of success can open up a lot of interesting opportunities
   > for further semesters.

1. What do you think is the biggest misconception many high school seniors have about college life?

   > That grades remain largely the same. Say goodbye to a standardized system;
   > each professor and class has a unique grading system, style, and scale, and
   > while it all gets translated to the same thing in the end, it can change
   > how you view your performance. Additionally, while a B- may not have been
   > enough for some high-schoolers, it can be quite a good grade for a college
   > student struggling through a difficult class.

This is the first in a two part-series. Next week I’ll share Ben’s thoughts on
adapting to the social life on campus, time management tips and lessons learned
about freshman survival.

## Part 2: Freshman Survival Secrets

Ben Knoble, a 2016 graduate of Ardrey Kell High School in Charlotte and a
first-year student at UNC Chapel Hill shared his wisdom about what was a very
successful first semester; both academically and socially.

Last week Ben’s responses focused more on the academic transition from high
school to college and this week I tried to understand the intricacies of
adjusting to college socially.

1. What’s the best tip you can give a student who is a little anxious about creating a social life on campus?

   > Get started early, if you’re really worried. You’ll find that there are
   > students across the intro/extrovert spectrum, and more than likely there will
   > be plenty of social events in the early days of that first semester. Challenge
   > yourself to go out and try them, or to connect with your hallmates and plan a
   > movie night. There will be, somewhere, a group that you enjoy.

1. What would you say to students who are concerned about being around too much partying?

   > You can avoid it if you want to. It’s really that simple---you’ll either
   > know where all the parties are or (like me) you won’t have a clue what’s
   > going on during the weekend because you haven’t been looking for it.

1. How easy/difficult has it been to find “your people?”

   > Finding my people was as simple as connecting with my floor and my
   > classmates. They’re all passionate and driven, but most important their
   > [sic] supportive and willing to listen to each other’s passions.

1. Have you joined any clubs/activities? If so, which ones and why?

   > Yes. I joined a Presbyterian campus ministry group because when I visited
   > their church the students were welcoming and friendly and, frankly, “my
   > people.” I also participate in EASE, which is a group centered on UNC’s
   > foreign exchange program. We welcome international students as they arrive,
   > act as their guides and point of contact for social activity, and generally
   > just get to know everyone and make sure they have a good semester. I did it
   > kind of on a whim, but it’s turned out to be an amazing source of
   > intellectual conversation and friendship.

1. Is managing your money challenging for many freshmen?

   > For some, I’ve seen it be challenging, while for others it’s been simple.
   > One piece of advice I have is that, if you’re worried about your
   > money-management skills, start practicing your junior or senior year. Start
   > getting used to being responsible for yourself, and by the time you get to
   > college it’ll be second nature.

1. How important are time management skills for freshmen?

   > On a scale of 1 to extremely, beyond extremely. Keeping your workload light
   > that first semester can help you develop those skills if you don’t have
   > them, and there are plenty of on-campus resources to help develop them.
   > Planning your breaks in between classes to get work done is helpful as
   > well, but not a necessity. The most important part is simply to stay on top
   > of the work---don’t put it off if you can get it done early.

1. You stayed pretty close to home; in retrospect, was that a good decision? Why?/Why not?

   > Being this close to home has its advantages: when I need to be home for
   > events, it’s far more doable than if I was in, say, California. However, I
   > am just far enough away that I don’t feel like my parents are breathing
   > down my neck. It’s a combination of nearby safety-nets if needed and a good
   > deal of freedom when they’re not.

1. What are your biggest “lessons learned” that you’d like to share?

   > Don’t let your laundry pile up! If you wait too long, it can be really
   > difficult to get it all done, and you’ll run out of clothes in the
   > meantime. And while we’re on the subject, try to do your laundry at odd
   > times. It’s really frustrating to want to do laundry and all of the
   > machines are full.

_Original Post_

In the following two articles, I focus mostly on the academic and social
challenges of my first semester at UNC Chapel Hill (Go Heels!). Probably the
most important advice, though, is this:

> Pick a place you’ll walk around smiling. That extra bit of happiness counts
> more than academics or social life. If you don’t enjoy looking at the campus
> for a day or two, you won’t enjoy it for four years.

You can find Part 1 [here][part_1] and Part 2 [here][part_2]. Later, the
Raleigh News & Observer picked up the first article [here][raleigh].
