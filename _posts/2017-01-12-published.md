I spent part of my Junior and most of my Senior year working with Lee Bierer,
columnist and independent college counselor at [CAS][cas]. After my first
semester, she interviewed me about my experiences in college and published the
results.

You can find Part 1 [here][part_1] and Part 2 [here][part_2].  Later, the
Raleigh News & Observer picked up the first article [here][raleigh].
