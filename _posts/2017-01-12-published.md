I spent part of my Junior and most of my Senior year working with Lee Bierer,
columnist and independent college counselor at [CAS][cas]. After my first
semester, she interviewed me about my experiences in college and published the
results.

In the following two articles, I focus mostly on the academic and social
challenges of my first semester at UNC Chapel Hill (Go Heels!). Probably the
most important advice, though, is this:

> Pick a place you’ll walk around smiling. That extra bit of happiness counts
> more than academics or social life. If you don’t enjoy looking at the campus
> for a day or two, you won’t enjoy it for four years.

You can find Part 1 [here][part_1] and Part 2 [here][part_2]. Later, the
Raleigh News & Observer picked up the first article [here][raleigh].
