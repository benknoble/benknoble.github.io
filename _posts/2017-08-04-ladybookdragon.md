Long have I wanted to write book reviews on this blog. I have not yet made it
there, but a friend of mine has.

Go check out [Lady Book Dragon](https://ladybookdragon.wixsite.com/ladybookdragon),
where a friend of mine at Elon is writing about the books she reads.

Wondering what the odd name means? Me too, frankly. I suspect it's a G. R. R.
Martin reference, or possibly something far more obscure, but knowing the dragon
behind the lady I'm more inclined to believe she created it as her own.
