Every Chrismtas, my younger brother and I bake cutout cookies with our
grandma. These are their stories.

<H2>The Process</H2>

Now that you're drooling at the site of the cookies, I'll include this brief
and boring discussion on the process. Feel free to skip it and go eat cookies.

Basically, we mix the dough, roll it out, cut it with cutters, bake the
cookies, mix the icing, put the sprinkles on with egg whites, do the icing
(and coconut, in the case of Santa Claus), and then eat them.

Not too bad, right? Except that it takes all day.
