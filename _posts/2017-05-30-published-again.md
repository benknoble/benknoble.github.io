## Part 1: Secrets to a successful freshman year

Last fall, I reached out to Ben Knoble for his wisdom on adjusting to freshman
year of college.

Ben was a 2016 Ardrey Kell High School graduate and had just started at UNC
Chapel Hill. His sage words resonated with students and parents, and so I
thought I would circle back and find out how the rest of his year went.

At the end of his first year, he’s still happy and can comfortably say he has
“no regrets.”

In high school, Ben was a high-achieving student who chose to conduct a very
thorough college search process. As the son of two Tar Heel grads, Chapel Hill
was a very familiar place and yet he was still open-minded about other kinds of
college experiences. He researched and visited colleges locally and as far away
as California. So it was a little surprising that in the end he chose to attend
UNC Chapel Hill.

Ben offers some great advice to freshmen in this Part 1 of a 4-part “Lessons
Learned” series. Ben and I are both hoping that these columns will be helpful
for high school seniors about to graduate and head off to college in the fall
and for parents desperate to impart some actionable wisdom.

### “Lessons learned” from freshman year

Today, Ben’s talking about how to take advantage of your newfound independence,
dabble in activities, explore your passions. But don’t go crazy – strive for
balance.

**“What do you think made the biggest contribution to your successful freshman
year?”**

> I’ll be honest; a large portion of it was natural independence. I don’t need a
> lot; I don’t mind a simple life, and I don’t spend money frequently. That
> lends itself, as you might expect, to an easier college transition. But that
> is only the beginning. Once you’re used to how college runs, how you keep up
> with what’s going on and how you de-stress, you want to start branching out
> some.

> You hear about all the fun things your very “Type-A” friends are doing (if you
> are Type-A, kudos to you—you’ll more than likely be fine if you don’t overload
> your plate). You want to get involved. And this is where that light first
> semester really helps out.

> If you have time to discover your passions on campus, they’ll be built into
> your schedule already before you start adding more and more. And while that
> can seem daunting—adding more and more activities until you feel like your
> plate is finally full—it’s not. Remember, this is college. These are
> probably the best years of your young life. Enjoy them. Don’t be afraid to try
> something new just because a friend mentioned it (but be safe). And if it
> doesn’t work out, oh well. Drop it, and keep your eyes open for the next
> thing.

> But I know as well as anybody that sometimes it all gets to you. You get home
> one evening from lab, and you know you still have things to do. Are you really
> going to be excited about your get-together tomorrow? Here’s the secret—yes.
> Yes, you will. In the morning. Right now, you’ve got to do exactly what you
> need to do to relax and get a good night’s sleep. If that’s shutting yourself
> in with Netflix and a fuzzy blanket, people will understand. If that’s getting
> dinner with those two friends who always give you a stitch in your side,
> they’ll be happy to pick you up.

> Your friends and your de-stress activities, those are the strongest pieces of
> your support network. They hold you up so that you can sleep without worry and
> wake up tomorrow feeling brand new. And then you can be happy that you’re so
> involved.

Check back next week for Part 2, where you can learn more from Ben about the
importance of making connections freshman year.

## Part 2: Lessons learned freshman year


When students share what makes them anxious about heading off to college, most
of them confess that they’re concerned about leaving the social comforts of high
school; their “friend group” and their familiar surroundings.

They wonder whether they will miss their high school friends and family too
much. They’re nervous about whether or not they will fit in and if they will
make a good first impression. It’s scary starting over.

But for some, this is the challenge that they’re most excited about. For them,
going to college is all about the opportunity for a clean slate and starting
fresh.

Many students who are proud of how they’ve matured during high school are
ecstatic to go somewhere and not have the baggage of their dumb moves from
sophomore year, or of not being surrounded by their ex and their ex’s friends.

But for everybody, freshman year is about connecting and making new friends. I
asked Ben Knoble, a 2016 Ardrey Kell grad and a soon-to-be sophomore at UNC
Chapel Hill how he felt about making the social transition to college.


**Ben Knoble, a soon-to-be UNC sophomore:** Friends made freshman year often end up
being a student’s closest friends. Do you feel that you have made friends for
life? Why? Why not?

> Yes. Absolutely, unequivocally, yes. “Why” tends to vary from group to group.
> My freshman friends are from the surrounding dorm area.

> We went through the ups and downs of a very exciting first year together. We
> cried for each other’s breakups, celebrated birthdays and jumped in unison
> during horror movies in the lounge. We know each other’s passions and fears.
> We may be spreading out over campus this coming fall, but when we need a
> friend or two, there they’ll be in our group chat, lovingly entitled “4th
> Floor Plus.”

> Sometimes, though, friendships develop purely out of common interests. You
> know, like how all of your friends in band seem to know everyone? I’ve made
> lifelong friends that way too. Sure, it starts with band, or a campus ministry
> group, or that computer science club that’s as quirky as you can imagine.
> Slowly, you get to know the faces. Maybe there are even nametags to help you
> out. And as you show up more often, talk to people more often, you find a
> couple of people that resonate with you. They make your day when they show up.

> Maybe you have deep conversations about the universe with your ministry group,
> or maybe it’s just being part of a bigger whole in band, or maybe it’s
> collaborating on projects or playing a good old-fashioned round of Super Smash
> Bros., but you find the people whose presence you miss sorely. Before you know
> it, you can’t wait to be back with those people.

> Sometimes friends crop up in strange places. Early in second semester, I had a
> group of friends decide that we wanted to eat lunch together one Monday. So we
> got in touch, figured out when, and showed up at the dining hall (Lenoir, for
> you UNC-bound folks), and began the eternal struggle that is finding a place
> to fit four people. And we had a great time talking. So the following
> Wednesday and Friday, when our schedules lined up, we did it again. And again.
> And again. And whoever got to Lenoir first had the wonderful responsibility of
> finding a table.

> Thus, the table-finding squad was born, and the four of us went on to eat
> lunch together 3 times a week, barring exceptional circumstances. We ate our
> last meal together for the semester one Friday night. We took photos in which
> we all lovingly glared at each other and said our goodbyes. The group chat,
> however, has still not died down, with a never-ending collage of animal-themed
> videos being sent my way when I need a pick-me-up.

> Your freshman year might not be mine. But generally, the people with whom you
> share your struggles and your joys freshman year will be bonded to you in ways
> you won’t even realize until it’s over. Don’t miss out on that.
