I've contributed small fixes to Git before, and I've started replying to the
mailing list more frequently, but [my first large contribution](https://lore.kernel.org/git/20250510183358.36806-1-ben.knoble+github@gmail.com/T/#m401ea75fd80edb213924368c016b01b52c8d57cf)
is now available to make `--index` the default for `git stash apply` and `git
stash pop` in Git 3.0.

**Update 2025 June 7th** Given the lack of enthusiasm or engagement, I'll
probably reroll this into a config option for now.
