**Update 2024 November 22: I may have some misunderstandings about trunk-based
development, and this article needs a (as-of-yet incomplete) rewrite as a
result.**

Pending said rewrites, the [main content][draft] has been removed as a "draft."
You can find the [original post][draft] on [GitHub][draft].

[draft]: https://github.com/benknoble/benknoble.github.io/blob/248b8898789f8071a546458604e8f73458d6f7f5/_posts/2024-11-11-git-branch-trunk-perspective.md?plain=1
