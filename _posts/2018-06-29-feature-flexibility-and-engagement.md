## Let Me Tell You a Story...

My grandfather was, at one point in his career, a manager at GE. For all their
[current troubles][ge], they were, at the time, a hotbed of engineering prowess.
My grandfather, himself a Ph.D. electrical engineer with several patents, the
man who had sold newspapers, washed dishes, collected glass bottles, and worked
in a steel mill to pay his way through university, was proud to be among them.

He tells me stories about his employees and time there sometimes. And I never
hear complaints; I never hear, "She was always late" or, "He didn't Get Things
Doneâ„¢."

Because that didn't happen in my grandfather's team.
