My wife's iMessage on her Macbook devices had refused to show names for people
in her contacts for a while. Mine started doing the same thing, and I finally
solved the problem.

If your contacts don't show names in iMessage, make sure the phone number
associated with the contact has an area-code prefix (that's `+1` in the US).
iMessage seems to recognize that messages are coming from `+1 (XXX) YYY-ZZZZ`,
and it can't match that to a contact with phone number `XXXYYYZZZZ` (which is
how Contacts will display phone numbers sans area codes). Adding an area code
in Contacts usually triggers a transformation to the standard format and, more
importantly, allows iMessage to match things.
