I teach a lab, and think of a new way to teach I/O redirection operators.

## Problems to solve

We are software engineers, and we like to automate. We would prefer to automate:
- Keyboard input
- Output processing

Inputting entries for a program all day long is a boring job. So is copy-pasting
the output into emails, as input for other programs, or as a test.

## Solutions

Files. It's files all the way down.

### Input

We normally just type input while the program is running. We want to automate
that. We use the `<` operator:

```bash
cmd <file
```

It sucks in the contents of `file` and funnels it as input to `cmd`

### Output

Output is normally sent to the console screen. We usually want to capture it and
do something with it. We use the `>` operator:

```bash
cmd >file
```

It sucks the output of `cmd` and funnels it to `file`

You can combine them, too:

```bash
cmd <in >out
cmd >out <in
<in cmd >out
<in >out cmd
```
&c.
