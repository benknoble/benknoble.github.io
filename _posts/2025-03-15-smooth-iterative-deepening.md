title: 'To learn Vim, practice smooth, iterative deepening'

You already know to run `vimtutor` and read `:help`. Here's why:

- [Smooth, iterative
  deepening](https://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2025/03/10/rust-2025-intro/#smooth-iterative-deepening)
  means that you can get started with very basic maneuvers: Insert mode, arrow
  keys, `ZZ`. Give motions and Normal mode a try. As you find places to improve
  or change the editor, you can do so with advanced `:help` topics.
- As [Primeagen says](https://x.com/i/broadcasts/1RDxlzBlnXNGL) around the 1h30
  mark, Vim isn't hard: it's just different. We have preconceived notions of
  programming and editors that Vim doesn't fit into. The first time you learned
  what a file is or how a compiler creates an executable was equally
  foreign---you just don't remember that. I frankly agree that modern IDEs are
  more confusing and distracting with all the window cruft they bolt on.
- Vim is ultimately a tinkerer's tool (in addition to being a ubiquitous Vi):
  learn it or don't, but don't expect a completely out-of-the-box experience.
  Tinker!

Oh, and don't use a distro if you can avoid it. Prime agrees.
