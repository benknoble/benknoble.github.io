Here is my short list of steps for digital control.

## Basics

- Reject all cookies. Some sites [make this
  obnoxious](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/367370/389795), so I wind up
  trying to avoid them if possible. The [UK's ICO
  agrees](https://www.technologylawdispatch.com/2023/11/privacy-data-protection/reject-all-button-in-cookie-consent-banners-an-update-from-the-uk-and-the-eu/).
- Unsubscribe from email you don't want or need (or recognize!). Some email
  clients (like GMail) can do this automatically for you: [this is especially
  handy when unsubscribe links
  fail](https://deadsimpletech.com/blog/abuser_economy).
- Avoid autoplay and infinite scroll, like YouTube taking you to the next video
  automatically. Disable them or avoid the site.
- Disable, deny, or mute unimportant notifications. Ditto for location services
  and ads. (On iPhones, that's usually in "Settings" under each application.)
- Report and delete unsolicited DMs or texts from strangers.
- Silence calls from unknown numbers (use your phone's settings).
- Practice anti-phishing strategy: check URLs, look for signs of urgency. Here
  are several informational sites to hone your strategy:
    - [Office of the Comptroller of the Currency: "Phishing Attack Prevention: How to Identify & Avoid Phishing Scams"](https://www.occ.gov/topics/consumers-and-communities/consumer-protection/fraud-resources/phishing-attack-prevention.html)
    - [FTC: "Phishing"](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/small-businesses/cybersecurity/phishing)
    - [America's Cyber Defense Agency: "Recognize and Report Phishing"](https://www.cisa.gov/secure-our-world/recognize-and-report-phishing)
- Be mindful. Ask yourself: why am I reading, watching, or consuming this? Who
  wrote or created it?

## Intermediate

- Try an [RSS
  Reader](https://pluralistic.net/2024/10/16/keep-it-really-simple-stupid/):
  instead of handing out your email address or social handle to have information
  shoved at you, collect a list of links to follow for updates when you want
  them. (Sound too good to be true, like the days when Facebook worked? [RSS is
  almost 26 years old as of this article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS).)
- Consider alternate browsers and search engines. Recent trends favor engines
  like [Ecosia](https://www.ecosia.org) and [Kagi](https://kagi.com), as well as
  browsers from [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/) (though Firefox has
  been [under some fire
  lately](https://www.reuters.com/technology/mozilla-hit-with-privacy-complaint-over-firefox-user-tracking-2024-09-25/)).
- Be aware of how much time you spend on individual sites (esp. the usual social
  suspects like Twitter, Instagram, the [cesspit that is
  Facebook](https://www.wheresyoured.at/the-slop-society/), YouTube, etc.)
- Practice skepticism. Many people have something to sell you: question
  motivations. Study arguments and how and why they are made. Decide for
  yourself if they are persuasive.
- Find self-awareness: listen to your emotional state as you consume. Are you
  allowing media to exert pathos-directed influence on you? Why? If it's
  genuine, what action does this prompt?
- Use Linux. This is not nearly as hard as it used to be!
  [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/desktop) is the flagship for "user-friendly"
  distributions, but you might be interested in other variants and
  distributions[^1]. Get your local techie friends to help (make some if you
  have to). According to Iris Meredith of
  [deadSimpleTech](https://deadsimpletech.com/), so much surveillance happens
  through operating systems today: relying on a system that won't surveil you
  gives you back control.

## Advanced

- Invest in digital privacy. Use your local techie friends for these, too. This
  usually becomes the costliest step financially, but should lead to the most
  control. Remember, you don't have to use most things you don't want to, and
  there's often an analog route to what you seek.
    - You might [try a VPN](https://tailscale.com/) or [set up a network-level
      tracking blocker](https://nextdns.io/).
    - [What do I do now?](https://www.citationneeded.news/wind-the-clock/):
      Covers privacy/security, forming community, etc.
    - [WIRED guide to protecting yourself from government
      surveillance](https://www.wired.com/story/the-wired-guide-to-protecting-yourself-from-government-surveillance/)
- Use more open-source software. If it goes in a direction you dislike, you
  always have the right to the source to build, modify, and run it yourself!
  (This typically comes with an educational cost: you might have to learn to
  build, modify, and run programs!) Corollary: avoid proprietary platform
  lock-in. See for example [Give Up
  GitHub](https://sfconservancy.org/GiveUpGitHub/); I've been eyeballing
  [sourcehut](https://sr.ht) for a while, personally.

## Notes

[^1]: For resource-constrained devices or older PCs, you may want to try an
    alternative, lighter-weight [desktop
    environment](https://wiki.debian.org/DesktopEnvironment). Power users might
    be interested in projects like [Arch](https://archlinux.org) (which powers
    SteamDeck OS version 3.0), [GNU Guix](https://guix.gnu.org) on [its own
    OS](https://guix.gnu.org/manual/en/html_node/System-Installation.html) or
    any GNU/Linux distribution of your preference, or [Nix on
    NixOS](https://nixos.org). If you're curious about the OS that powers most
    embedded devices (including parts of the Nintendo Switch and the PS4), try
    [FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org). [Debian](https://www.debian.org)
    underlies the original SteamOS versions 1.0 and 2.0 as well as Ubuntu.
