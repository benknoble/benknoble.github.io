I've added comments, and subscriptions, and moved the feed to be more
accessible.

## Feed Me

The RSS feed has always been located right at [/feed.xml](/feed.xml). This
hasn't changed. What has is that a direct link is now provided in the footer.

## Subscribe Me

Using feedburner, I have put together and email subscription service. Simply
click [subscribe][] here or in the footer.

[subscribe]: https://feedburner.google.com/fb/a/mailverify?uri=github/ZRoM&amp;loc=en_US

## Comment on Me

I've opted to use Disqus to put comments on the blog. Enjoy.
I'll be putting a comment policy together at some point and posting it, but for
now use the following guidelines:

 - be nice
 - stay on topic

You have been warned.
