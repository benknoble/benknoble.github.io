In a _Wall Street Journal_ opinion piece titled ["American Society Was Built for
Populism, Not
Elitism"](https://www.wsj.com/opinion/american-society-was-built-for-populism-not-elitism-nature-and-history-prove-technocrats-wrong-cf9e7a2f?page=1)
(paywalled), Karl Zinsmeister argues that power has concentrated largely in
the hands of experts and authorities "indoctrinated in universities" (in other
words, too liberal for the mainstream).

While he correctly assess a backlash to authoritarian and central control, he
misses both symptom and cause. The backlash is not against a supposedly
left-leaning power network, but rather against an oligarchic class whose waves
of corrupt money have undue influence in American life. [FTC Commissioner Alvaro
M. Bedoya understands what people
need](https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/bedoya-statement-emergency-motion.pdf):

> anything about it. And how they’re going broke because of it.

If there is also a backlash against the scientific institutions of universities,
it is due to a [protracted campaign against
epistemology](https://pluralistic.net/2024/09/25/epistemological-chaos/) by big
business. Oligarchs have an easier time staying rich in a world muddied by
misinformation. Meanwhile, we explicitly _want_ to delegate fact-finding to the
experts: that creates [evidence-based
policy](https://pluralistic.net/2024/11/21/policy-based-evidence/).

What is Zinsmeister's solution to his spectre of centralized liberal control?
Hand over federal programs to private control: his writing on American
philanthropy indicates to me that he believes a wealthy élite will rule instead.
Same centralized control, different powerful controllers.

The answer is neither populism nor technocracy nor oligarchy. The answer is
regulation of power and markets and strong institutional science (necessarily
separated from government).
