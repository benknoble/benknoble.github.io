Simplicity is a feature.

I built a tiny FAQ site to help Vimmers understand the idiosyncrasies of using
Vim at Capital One. A colleague quipped:

Indeedâ€”3 or 4 interlinked HTML pages and a single CSS file load quickly in any
browser _because that's what browsers were designed for._

[It's not hard to go fast if you don't overengineer](https://infrequently.org/series/performance-inequality).
