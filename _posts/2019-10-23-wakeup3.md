Day 3 of the early-bird experiment.

## Day 3

Today's accomplishments:

- vi.stackexchange.com
- uploaded another class recording
- started work on a hex-editing mode for vim
- watched an episode of Yu-gi-oh!
- worked on a research program

And, of course, I wrote this post.

## BS/MS

The really exciting news today is that I was accepted to the BS/MS program at
UNC Chapel Hill! This means I'll be staying in school for an extra year to do a
master's in Computer Science, and I'm *very* excited.
