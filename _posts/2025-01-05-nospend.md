My wife and I want to be (even more) intentional with our spending this year as
we work through the purchase of a home. Here are our ideas.

The goal is not to keep to these perfectly, but to use them as strong guidelines
when evaluating spending decisions in these categories. This should keep us
conscious of where our money goes (alongside our usual budgeting) without
feeling punitive.

## Guidelines this year

1. No coffee out unless it is building a relationship (_e.g._, friend, family,
   coworker).
1. No new clothes or shoes unless replacing items that are worn out or do not
   fit.
1. No books except book of the month or book club books that cannot be found at
   the library.
1. No new cosmetics or toiletries except replacements.
1. No new cleaning or household supplies except replacements.
1. Eat out 6 times or fewer per month unless building a relationship.
1. Maximum 3 treats per month.
1. No new cups, mugs, water bottles, etc.
1. No new board games, video games, Lego, etc.
