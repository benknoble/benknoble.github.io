I haven't done (or kept) New Year's Resolutions in a long time. [This
article][nye] from the [Angry GM][] inspired me to do them differently.

## What am I doing?

Angry, in typically sardonic fashion, writes

And it's this last bit that really gets me: how often have I discussed
goal-setting frameworks (SMART, from Boy Scouts of America; a myriad of
Health/fitness classes; the list goes on)? And how many of them emphasize the
*specific*-ness and the *actionable*-ness of goals? (Hint: all of them.)

Worse, how often have I set goals and not relied on the frameworks I have in
front of me?

To that end, I am setting resolutions a bit differently this year. And, in the
vein of Angry, I am making them public. As Angry says:

> I’m just using myself as an example. […] Look around, figure out what’s wrong,

> you can change, even if it’s you—and then resolve to change it. And then, you
> know, actually make the f$&%ing change. Or die trying.

Here we go. What you're seeing is the raw 2021 resolutions document (powered by
my [wiki system][]). I'll update it from time to time, but it's a bit manual at
the moment (well, manual in-as-much as I open this post's source, navigate to
this line:

{% raw %}
```vim
/\V{% comment %} Do not edit below this line {% endcomment %}/+2,$ delete | read ~/.wiki/projects/resolutions/2021.md
```
{% endraw %}

and run `:exec getline('.')` in vim).
