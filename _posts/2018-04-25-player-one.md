Brace yourself. *The Oasis* launches in 3...2...1...

20 minutes later, I'm starting to get a little bored by the lackluster
backstory, told to me rather than shown. The opening of __Ready Player One__ is
loaded, weighted down really, by details about the world it inhabits. But
frankly, who cares? We all came to see the action-packed, retro film Spielberg
does so well.  Fortunately, it does eventually arrive.

Our hero and guide on this journey, Wade "Parzival" Watts, takes on the
challenge of the Oasis' dead creator : find 3 keys in the blissful virtual
reality, and become its owner. Along the way, fall into nearly every pop culture
reference, sci-fi fantasy cliché, and real-life drama and romance you can
imagine.

### Some other movies

Frankly, though, part of this film's success comes from its handle on pop
culture and clichés. Take, for example, the name "Parzival"--called out on
screen as a reference to the crusading knights seeking the [Holy Grail][grail],
it actually servers to anchor part of Spielberg's commentary. A commentary which
of course must be attributed to the book's original author, [Ernest
Cline][cline].

Similarly to the [Indian Jones grail][jones], the easter egg at the end of
Watts' path takes on far more humble origins when (spoilers follow) it becomes
evident that the grail is a test and a temptation. Also featured is Monty
Python's ["Quest for the Holy Grail,"][python] whose explosive callback I'll
leave you to find.

Other tropes to find include "evil dystopian slave company," "amusingly helpful
butler," and "giant robot dinosaurs."

### Morals, I guess

What other commentaries can we dig out of __Ready Player One__ ? Well, for one,
it's reminiscent of esports in a number of ways. You have real people competing
online for money and "stuff™," and it ends up becoming a real way of life. But
it goes deeper, it sucks people in. They avoid the harsh realities of their
world for *The Oasis*, an escapist fantasy. Wade's arrival at the truth, that
"Reality is real," becomes thus the (extra) life-saving game-changer. It's
almost like [__Le Petit Prince__][prince], who taught us that "the essential is
invisible to the eyes."

The "butler" later admits in person that the game was never meant to be played
solo. Up to you to decide if he meant *The Oasis* or life. But it piques another
point relevant to today's game culture: couch co-op, solo mode, and online
multiplayer. Will we continue to move towards lonely gamers playing with online
friends, or will we see a resurgence of the "party friendly" cooperative
community games?

Finally, let's touch on one last point: screen addiction, and the intertwining
of reality and virtuality. The film makes a clear point about both dystopia
video games. There *can* be too much of a good thing. It also raises the
interesting philosophical question of real-world effects for virtual actions.
I'm not only talking about the delivery of prizes earned for feats accomplished
online, but the way Watts calls together a virtual army in the game and later a
physical one to protect his human body. It's rather reminiscent of The Matrix,
actually, with the cables and headsets and evil men descending in suits upon the
kid's body, still hooked into the machine.

But Watts' actions, both virtually and in real life, impact all those around
him. They cause people to move and make decisions. They stand up. They engage in
reality. And as we grow ever closer to 2045 and a world dominated by our online
presence(s), how will we reconcile the effects and consequences of our actions?
How will we redefine responsibility? How will the *law* work?

## Conclusion

Go in, suffer the first 20 minutes, and then forget all about it,
because this movie is one heck of a ride, with chase scenes in both worlds tying
up dozens of geek culture references into what feels less like a Grail quest and
more like a liberation. And don't forget your sense of nostalgia.
