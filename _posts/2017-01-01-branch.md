Sometimes, you need to do a particular operation on every single branch in a
repo, like pushing or merging. I thought it would be difficult. It's not.

<H2>The Code (Script)</H2>

_Preface: I do use [Bash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)) (no arguing about which shell is best), so this may
not apply to everyone. I'm looking at you, Windows people._

```bash
for branch in $(ls .git/refs/heads); do
    git checkout $branch
    # git operation on branch
done
```

*Update* It has come to my attention that rather than parsing `ls` output, we
can use globs.

```bash
for branch in .git/refs/heads/*; do
    branch="$(basename "$branch")"
    git checkout "$branch"
    # blah blah blah
done
```

The first part is a standard Bash for-loop. Lots of people caution against for
loops on files this way, but we're actually using filenames as branch names,
and this is far more readable than using `find`.

The tricky part is `$(ls .git/refs/heads)`. The `$()` bit means evaluate the
parentheses as a shell command. The `ls .git/refs/heads` bit lists the files
in .git/refs/heads, whose names are the names of branches.

Thus, we have a loop over the branch names. `git checkout $branch` is familiar
to git cli users; simply checkout the branch. Then perform any operations on
it you'd like. `done` signals the end of the loop.

<H3>Variations</H3>

You can optionally quote the branch listing into `"$(ls .git/refs/heads)"`.

You can also follow `done` with another command, like checking out master
again. You would then have `done; git checkout master`.

<H2>Uses</H2>

My most frequent uses are pushing all branches to remotes, and merging all
branches with master. I only do this when I know it's a fast-forward merge,
but this makes it relatively easy to quickly update all branches with
the lastest master developments (probably themselves merged in from
one of the branches).
