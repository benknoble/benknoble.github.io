This is my first "Today I Learned" on the new schedule, though it now spans
multiple "today"s...

## Today I Learned

1. I can be indecisive
2. Free food is often a learning experience
3. The best friends are the ones you _can_ tell everything, but to whom you
   don't _have_ to say anything.

### What Do I Do!

Since my last TIL, I've played in two RPGs: _Shadow of the Demon Lord_, and _In
Nomine_. They are both excellent games: one, for it's gruesome gritty gothic-ness; the
other for it's take on angels, demons, and the human world of Earth.

But it turns out I struggle with making decisions about and for my characters.

I'm really good at building a character--be it to a concept or for a particular
combo, I know the rules and abilities so back-to-front, I can design
highly-specialized characters. I'm also pretty good at coming up with character
concepts that I would enjoy playing.

In game, I usually have a fair idea of my character. Or, I thought I did. I
realized I've been playing my character more like a collection of traits (read:
stereotypes) than like a real person--that is, more like an NPC than a PC. My
characters would often have several traits that really stood out to define
them, like how my dwarven paladin in Demon Lord didn't trust non-dwarves, didn't
like meddling with human affairs, and was constantly cursing or praying.

This may come from GM'ing, but this style of character is almost exactly what
NPCs do--they provided a (sometimes slapdash) collection of traits and a vehicle
for story, information, plot, or worldbuilding.

Unfortunately, every now and then I'm confronted with an unexpected situation,
one which I hadn't already thought through a little for my character, and then I
fall apart. It takes me several sputtering starts, much like an older car in
need of a new battery, to get going and figure out what this person would do or
say. Especially say. It's kind of terrifying.

Practice makes perfect?

### Tables and Teachings

Ok, so yes, sometimes I just love a good heading and a witty aphorism. But this
one has purpose.

Friday, I got to have lunch with other interns and co-ops and the Raleigh GM,
who spoke to us about Nokia and how Nuage fits in. Today, we had lunch again
with the Nuage COO, who calls himself the Chief Gopher (as in "go-fer-things").
He gave an in-depth look at Nuage's technology, platform, and the problems it's
solved since conception. He also examined the problems it will be solving in the
future, and a couple of takeaway lessons.

My point, without dwelling for too long on the every single detail, is that
these luncheons were both highly informative from a business persepctive, but
also personally. I got to know people, and I learned a few things about
emotional intelligence, project management, product design, and excellence.

So, as if you needed another reason, don't turn down free food.

### I'll Be There for You

While I still haven't obsessively watched _Friends_ end-to-end, I will
reference the theme for my purposes.

Yesterday I met up with an old friend, and what started as a short walk-and-chat
turned into a 5 hour conversation. We weren't talking the entire time, but when
we were, it was about any and everything, from relationships to family drama to
random things from random parts of our lives. Tangents sprung up out of nowhere
and then folded back into the story being told. Jokes were made, laughs and
glares given and received, insights were shared.

Granted, we've developed our unique brand of friendship over many years, but
there was something about the complete frankness of it all that had me smiling
almost non-stop, even when I was ranting or exasperatedly huffing and puffing.

And the best part is that we can share that--that, friend to friend, we can
comment on patterns and behaviors we've noticed and say, "Hey, friend, this is
what I've noticed, and I think it's what's hurting or helping you."

That takes courage, to say and hear those things. But we can do that. And it
makes a world of difference.
