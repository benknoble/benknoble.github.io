title: Feature—Taking a Break

The animal kingdom has known for centuries, if not millenia, that breaks are a
necessary fact of life. Why, then, do we so often forget to take them?

## (Not so) Brief Musings on Brief Breaks

When I get buried deep in a project, as I did on Friday (when this post was
supposed to be written), I get into a "zone". This [zone][] is well-documented
and studied; it is crucial to our ability to Get Things Done™. Interrupting it
carries all the peril of interrupting a feeding [T. Rex][]. And, as Einstein so
famously proved, time is relative---at least, when "in the zone," consumed by
furiously-paced mental or physical exercise, it seems to go from 0 to 60 in a
heartbeat.

This zone also takes anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour to cultivate, and any
interruption triggers a restart from square one---or even square *negative* one.
So why do I find myself taking short breaks after a few hours in the zone?

It comes down to this:

1. Short breaks are good; and
2. Short breaks don't interrupt.

In fact, they provide an opportunity for a wide variety of other necessary
activities. My most frequent breaks are bathroom runs, efficiently combining a
chance to stand and stretch with more pressing tasks.

If you've ever heard of or talked about doing your best thinking in the shower
(or on the toilet), then you know what #2 is getting at. My trip to the bathroom
is a mental stimulus, not a slowdown. It jogs me out of whatever stagnant
thinking patterns I've become engaged in, literally changes my perspective, and
forces me to tackle my current problem differently. Much like [rubber-duck
debugging][], it is an essential tool and has saved me on more than one
occasion.

## And Now, a Return to Your Regularly Scheduled Programming

By the time my short break has ended, I'm ready to dive in again. My eyes have
relaxed, my brain shaken itself out, and generally I'm feeling much better. But
this effect doesn't have to come only in short bursts.

And, more importantly, it can be dangerous to leave it out altogether.

### Why This Article is Late

Ok, so, maybe I should have led with this part, explained why it's showing up
now and not Friday. But I'm not the [AngryGM][], I don't have patented Long
Rambling Introductions™ (yet), and I think it makes more sense here.

Here's what happened: most nights this week after work, I sat down at my
computer, *maybe* watched an episode of [NCIS][], but mostly just read
programming articles, wrote code, and wrote for this blog. I did some reading
before bed, consulted my phone for news during dinner, and my brain was chugging
along most of the time at the same pace it was during work. I know this, because
I could hear the gears turning. They were starting to rust.

Saturday, I had planned to be really productive (Friday, I had done basically
the same as the rest of the week). I needed to Get Things Done™. I woke up a
little late, sleeping in to take advantage of the weekend as planned, thinking
that would be my "long break".

I then practiced [Tang Soo Do][] in practice for a test coming up this Friday
(don't worry, you'll still get your feature). Feeling sufficiently invigorated,
I took the bike out for a 5mi ride.

And then things collapsed.

See, I spent the rest of Saturday post-shower-and-lunch watching Netflix or the
television ([NCIS][] is my all-time favorite, with [Grey's][] close
behind---plus [Law & Order: SVU][] was marathoning again). Productivity levels:
$$0$$.

### Sine waves

Like most things in life, ups and downs are the key to all of this. Sunday,
today, I *was* productive. I took care of so many things I wanted to get done.
And man did it feel good. But would I have been able to do that fresh off my
first week of work after a few weeks of summer vacation? Heck no! I had to rest,
relax, rebound.

I guess I really like the [3 R's…][].

Anyways, now you know the whole story. You know that it is important for me to
have short thinking breaks and longer zombie ones (although, *"zombie"* here is
relative---as long as I'm not directly working on or thinking about what I've
been working on all week, I'm probably ok). You know that not breaking at all
can be dangerous---everyone has tried it; it's either fatal or it fails. And, you
know that you make it through anything because your future is in the `sin`s, if
you know how to read them.

__Notes__

P.S. I'm sorry about that pun.

P.P.S. No I'm not.

P.P.P.S. This article is *both* an essay on breaks and a wonderful excuse to
finish it late. I do love it when a plan comes together.

If you're interested, [Joel][] has written a lot about the zone and how
programming intersects with business. Check him out so you can make me want to
work for you instead.
