## Apologies (Are a Sign of [Weakness][])

But that doesn't mean we shouldn't still give them at times. So,

1. The emoji aren't going away. I thought long and hard about it, and they save
   cycles. I don't have to go through the rigamarole of getting a picture on the
   site, they load faster than pictures, and I can type them directly with
   jekyll (like `:bike:`).
2. This is actually an extension of what I wanted to write about on [Monday][].
3. I'm sorry for the further delay to this content. So let's get to it!

## Cycles

So, as much I love both cycling and re-cycling, this post is actually about
neither of those things. As you might remember, I was going to write about how
everything runs on cycles. And so here I am. (In fact, when I finish linking to
this article in Monday's TIL, there will be a cycle there too.)

Actually, we have to go back a little farther in my logic chain, though I
promise I'll circle back around eventually. I was going to write about cycles
because of something my coworkers say, and it has stuck in my head.

The phrase goes like this:

> If anyone has spare cycles, speak up and we'll give you work.

It has a few variants, namely,

> I've got spare cycles, anything I can help with?

Much like Agile sprints, the phrase is predicated that we work in cycles,
CPU-style. We have to choose where to spend those cycles: laundry, shopping,
working on a caching problem, or checking email, just to name a few.

See, a CPU processes information in cycles. They all have varying *speeds*, which
determine how many cycles they have in a clock tick. And most operating systems
have a scheduler which determine what processes get to run when (and with which
resources). So the CPU is constantly deciding what things take priority.

Now, imagine you're a CPU. Go on, become a piece of silicon. Or, rather, imagine
that you have lots of things vying for your attention, and you have to decide
what gets done and what doesn't. Sounds more realistic, doesn't it? Now imagine
one of those things says, "Hey, CPU, I'm doing this thing over here with my
friends, and I can't move forward on my task until it's done. But you can't do
this thing, I have to do it on this other CPU."

Are you going to prioritize doing it? You can't, can you? So, instead, you look
at your other tasks and you get something done. Because you are a mindless piece
of silicon, programmed by Silicon-DNA to be productive and Get Stuff Doneâ„¢.

### Sleepy & Other Dwarves

This came up at work because I had a "sleepy" process--I mentioned
[regressions][] yesterday, and they have decided they need to work before I can
continue, but they don't feel like working.

As a good CPU, I mean, intern, I wasn't going to sit on my thumbs and wait for
something to happen. So I took on the DHCP clustering, then later other
projects. I stayed busy.

## *Everything?* Really?

Well, yes. I mean, I don't want to get too "Circle of Life" on you, since I
don't have time and I need to wrap this up. But everything is about how you
spend your cycles. What do you choose to do today? What do you accomplish and
prioritize? What keeps getting put on the back-burner?

Most importantly, *how* do you choose?

Do you have a system? You don't have to have a perfect, neatly organized system.
But you need something. Complete chaos is the unformed stuff of imagination and
dreams, and it's good and all. It's what sparks us. But to stay in motion, we
have to have cycles. Like wheels. And they aren't frictionless, I'm sorry to
say.

So, how do you choose? Is life an Agile sprint, with backlogs and stories? Is
it a pile of Sticky Notes, a file on your computer? Are your priorities dictated
to you?

Spend a cycle thinking about it. Trust me, it's worth it.
