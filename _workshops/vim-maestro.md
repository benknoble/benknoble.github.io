[Material](https://github.com/benknoble/vim-maestro)

Given circa summer 2018 for Nuage Networks and Nokia interns who wanted to
become vim maestros.

This is my first (and roughest) workshop. We ran out of time, and by the end I
hadn't convinced anyone that it was worth it to learn vim (although my attendees
didn't follow along with the exercises :P ).

There is some good stuff in the slides, if you're learning.
