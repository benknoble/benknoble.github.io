(This "workshop" has lasted to the present)

My goal is to raise the bar on Git use within Capital One by exposing engineers
to best practices, tools they might not know, and their benefits.

Part 1 launched in 2024 as a personal weekly side-project. I recorded weekly
short tutorial videos (5 minutes or less) and 30-minute long-form group sessions
with guided practice, Q&A, and discussions of best practices.

My workshops helped inform multiple developer teams' decisions for Git norms and
enterprise-wide best practices.

At the end of 2024, I realized I couldn't sustain a weekly recording pace. I
also developed grander plans to develop structured learning paths for Git and
make all our recordings available to the public, which I couldn't do alone.

As a result, I switched to a community stewardship model: other developers at
Capital One host workshops once a month, with myself and a team of volunteers
providing guidance and structure as necessary. I lead the overall strategic
direction and still occasionally produce a workshop or article.
