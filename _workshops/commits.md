## or, Why You Should Write Detailed Commit Messages

(No material publicly available.)

Given at a technology education series on best practices at Capital One.

> Commit messages matter. Git already knows how to answer questions like "who,"
> "what," "when," and "where." With a good commit message, you can teach Git
> "why."
>
> Good commit messages create a virtuous cycle and are one of the few
> investments we can make that pay dividends virtually forever.

This talk eventually launched my internal Git Office Hours series, consisting of
weekly short tutorial videos (5 minutes or less) and 30-minute long-form
sessions with guided practice, Q&A, and discussions of best practices.

My goal is to raise the bar of Git use within Capital One by exposing engineers
to best practices, tools they might not know, and their benefits. I also serve
as a resource to lay out all sides of difficult trade-offs.
