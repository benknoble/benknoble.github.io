## or, Why You Should Write Detailed Commit Messages

(No material publicly available.)

Given at a technology education series on best practices at Capital One. This
talk eventually launched my internal Git Office Hours series, consisting of
weekly short tutorial videos (5 minutes or less) and 30-minute long-form
sessions with guided practice, Q&A, and discussions of best practices. My goal
is to raise the bar of Git use within Capital One by exposing engineers to best
practices, tools they might not know, and their benefits. I also aim to serve as
a resource to help inform both sides of difficult trade-offs.
