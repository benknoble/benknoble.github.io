## or, Why You Should Write Detailed Commit Messages

(No material publicly available.)

Given at a technology education series on best practices at Capital One.

> Commit messages matter. Git already knows how to answer questions like "who,"
> "what," "when," and "where." With a good commit message, you can teach Git
> "why."
>
> Good commit messages create a virtuous cycle and are one of the few
> investments we can make that pay dividends virtually forever.
