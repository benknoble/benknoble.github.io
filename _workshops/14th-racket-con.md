[Material](https://github.com/benknoble/racket-con-2024) and [more
information](https://con.racket-lang.org).

Originally given at the 14th Racket Con to say "thank you," showcase some neat
features of Frosthaven Manager, and call for more community action.

> Consisting of more than 15k lines of code and documentation, written in spare
> time during the last two and a half years, the [Frosthaven
> Manager](https://github.com/benknoble/frosthaven-manager) would not exist
> without the Racket community. Let’s explore some of the community’s
> contributions, reflect on the benefits of building in the open, and dream
> about what comes next.
