## Stuff I read regularly now

(Or: things I enjoy now as a curious, non-conforming luddite with strong
principles.)

<ul>
{% for blog in site.data.reading_list['new'] %}
  <li>
  <a href="{{blog.url}}">{{blog.title}}</a>
  </li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>

## Stuff I read or intended to read as a (na√Øve?) student with copious free time

(Or: what I think helped me gain knowledge as a student & junior engineer.)

<ul>
{% for blog in site.data.reading_list['old'] %}
  <li>
  <a href="{{blog.url}}">{{blog.title}}</a>
  </li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>
