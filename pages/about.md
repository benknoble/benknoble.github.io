### The Site

[Junk Drawer][site] is hosted by [GitHub][github] Pages and powered by the
[Jekyll][jekyll] engine.

### Junk Drawer

So, what is the "Junk Drawer"? Good question. In my everyday life, no matter
where I'm living or working, there's always a drawer or desk space or shelf or
shoe box where I throw flyers, books, notes, scribbles, and thoughts. It's a
catchall, and often times it gets quite cluttered.

This blog is dedicated to being a virtual representation of my junk drawers,
holding musings and notes from my life. Primarily, I will try to write about
programming, but I will frequently digress to other topics, such as math,
language (reading, writing, or programming), music, or D&D.

To see my virtual Junk Drawer on GitHub, visit [benknoble/JunkDrawer][junk].

### Me

I'm D. Ben Knoble, an Honors Computer Science student at UNC Chapel Hill. I
have a second major in French and a minor in Math.

I rely on a healthy mix of self-taught experimentation and formal class training
for anything I do, including programming. Being self-taught keeps me curious. My
biggest personal interests in the computer science sphere are programming
languages and programming tools. Outside of that, I'm an avid biker,
clarinetist, martial artist, reader, and gamer.

For some of the projects I'm working on, check out
[benknoble@GitHub][benknoble], or try my [showcase][showcase]. I'm also on
the Stack Exchange network (primarly [vim][vim], though I still use
[StackOverflow][stack_overflow] as well as a few others).

### Technical

- Favorite __editor__: `vim`.

Editing should be done at the speed of thought, not the speed of click-and-drag
or the speed of which-function-key-is-it

- Favorite __IDE__: `tmux`.

No, it's not an IDE like Eclipse. It *is* a great way to manage projects and
terminals. (Note: I don't even use iTerm!  Terminal.app is good enough with
tmux, even if it doesn't support truecolor yet.)

- Favorite __shell__: `bash`.

It's the default, it's what I learned, it's just simple enough to be a really
great shell. It does what I need and doesn't get in my way. It's easier to
configure than zsh, and forces me not to rely on *too* many non-portable-isms. I
do wish sh would get proper (associative) arrays.

- Favorite __language__: a mix of `bash`, `make`, `vimscript`, the functional
stuff.

Scala is fun, but the JVM dependence makes it too heavy for me most of the time.
I want to learn perl, the lisp and ML families, and Haskell well enough to be
dangerous. After that, something older and something esoteric. Perhaps
smalltalk?

- Favorite __OS__: `macOS`.

I've been using a macbook since 2012 and it's here to stay. I'm not convinced on
the new touchbar thing yet though.

- Favorite __version control__: definitely `git`.

I think some people prefer the mercurial (hg) interface, but I'm not sold. Git
has outgrown its historical reputation for a complex interface, and is the de
facto standard.
