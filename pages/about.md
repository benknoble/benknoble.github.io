### The Site

[Junk Drawer][site] is hosted by [GitHub][github] Pages and powered by the
[Jekyll][jekyll] engine.

### Junk Drawer

So, what is the "Junk Drawer"? Good question. In my everyday life, no matter
where I'm living or working, there's always a drawer or desk space or shelf or
shoe box where I throw flyers, books, notes, scribbles, and thoughts. It's a
catchall, and often times it gets quite cluttered.

This blog is dedicated to being a virtual representation of my junk drawers,
holding musings and notes from my life. Primarily, I write about programming,
but I frequently digress to other topics.

These days my current virtual Junk Drawer is a private Git repo that holds all
my wiki files, managed by [wiki-md](https://github.com/benknoble/wiki-md). My
old virtual Junk Drawer on GitHub is at [benknoble/JunkDrawer][junk].

### Me

Hi, I'm Ben :wave: and my pronouns are he/him/his.

- I'm D. Ben Knoble, a Software Engineer at Capital One. I'm also [an active
  open source contributor][benknoble]. [See what others say about me]({% link
  pages/testimonials.md %}).
- I break down complex answers to simple questions. Read [Adam Gordon Bell's
  article for Earthly](https://earthly.dev/blog/thought-leaders/) to learn why.
  As it turns out, [we don't know much about software
  engineering](https://www.hillelwayne.com/talks/ese/). See also [Another kind
  of engineer]({% link _posts/2024-06-16-fp-hiring.md %}#another-kind-of-engineer).
- My hobbies include: Vim, Git, and the shell; games of all kinds; painting;
  cycling; martial arts; Clarinet; and French. Ask me anything about these!
- I believe in critically examining power structures wherever they appear. Ask
  me about my current reading, discussion groups, or how I'm trying to get
  involved in my community.
- I rely on a healthy mix of self-taught experimentation and formal class
  training for anything I do, including programming. Being self-taught keeps me
  curious. My biggest personal interests in the computer science sphere are
  programming languages and programming tools.
    - I completed a Master's in CS in 2021. I have also completed my
      undergraduate degree in CS and French, with a minor in Mathematics, which
      I completed in 2020.
- [By a wonderful fluke, my Erd≈ës number is 4](https://sites.google.com/site/dicksites/). My Top Gun number is 3.
- I'm keeping track of my "developer level" via a [set of challenges that span a
  broad array of programming, development, learning, and teaching
  categories](https://benknoble.github.io/level-up/).
- For some of the projects I'm working on, check out
  [benknoble@GitHub][benknoble], or try my [showcase][showcase]. I'm also on the
  Stack Exchange network (primarly [vim][vim], though I still use
  [StackOverflow][stack_overflow] as well as a few others).

Please [contact me][contact] with questions, corrections, or to chat.

### Technical

- Favorite __editor__: `vim`.

Editing should be done at the speed of thought, not the speed of click-and-drag
or the speed of which-function-key-is-it

- Favorite __IDE__: `tmux`.

No, it's not an IDE like Eclipse. It *is* a great way to manage projects and
terminals. (Note: I don't even use iTerm! Terminal.app is good enough with tmux,
even if it doesn't support truecolor yet. I have spent the last year or two in
Alacritty, however.)

- Favorite __shell__: `bash`.

It's the default; it's what I learned; it's just simple enough to be a really
great shell (the core really is small). It does what I need and doesn't get in
my way. It's easier to configure than zsh, and forces me not to rely on *too*
many non-portable-isms. I do wish sh would get proper (associative) arrays.

I have [switched to zsh]({% link _posts/2020-05-21-switch-zsh.md %}) for
interactive use, but bash and sh are still my automation go-tos.

- Favorite __languages__: a mix of shell, Make, Vimscript, and the
functional stuff (especially Racket).

I've written enough SML to really enjoy it (see my entries for the 2019 Advent
of Code, for example). Scala and Clojure are fun, but the JVM dependence makes
it too heavy for me most of the time. I appreciate the true smallness of C, and
have learned a lot from it. Haskell and Rust are next on my list. Then some new
paradigms: maybe true logic programming or something. After that, something
older and something esoteric.

(Languages I'm tired of? Python and JavaScript make the top of the list. The
former is everywhere, but it's functional-language side isn't on par with things
like SML or Clojure. The latter is, well, broken, though Deno seems to be making
progress.)

- Favorite __OS__: macOS.

I've been using a MacBook since 2012 and it's here to stay. I'm not convinced on
the new touchbar thing yet though.

- Favorite __version control__: definitely Git.

I think some people prefer the mercurial (hg) interface, but I'm not sold. Git
has outgrown its historical reputation for a complex interface, and is the de
facto standard.

- Favorite **keyboard**: my Ergodox EZ. Here's my
[layout](https://configure.zsa.io/ergodox-ez/layouts/BNalB/latest/0).

- Favorite __colorscheme__: I've been using Dracula for years. If you like
Dracula, too, consider [purchasing the Pro version through my affiliate
link](https://gumroad.com/a/968545299/tPfIDt). Dracula is used on this website
for code blocks, and I've contributed a lot to various open-source and Pro
components of the theme.
