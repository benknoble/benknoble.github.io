- "The next [Will Slattum](https://github.com/wrslatz)"
- "Ben models working across silos by the level of his involvement with the
  innersource community. Known in the top 10 active participants, Ben is sought
  out as various topics and working group arise. We need more 'Ben's in the

  for how engineers can own how they work and contribute back in a meaningful
