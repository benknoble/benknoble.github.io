      <h1>Testimonials</h1>
      <ul>
  <li>“I really appreciate your ability to encourage active discourse during
meetings especially during workshop retrospectives. During the last workshop
retrospective you were able to mantle different personas based on what the
context called for. At times you worked as a facilitator encouraging
conversation and making sure we stayed on track. Other times, you engaged more
directly as a peer in conversation. The seamless transition is notable only
because of your effectiveness in pulling it off bringing all the benefits of
each persona together. It keeps engagement high, don’t stop!”</li>
  <li>“Helped me expand my reach, provided impact for me and the team, and made me
feel welcomed by talking through tasks, careers, and life.”</li>
  <li>
    <p>“Ben is an extremely talented developer whose passion for Git and the <a href="/workshops/git-office-hours/">Git
Office Hours</a> is very evident. He
is very proactive in creating meeting plans and notes, and is very
professional in guiding the direction of the meetings we held. Furthermore,
Ben is very active in assisting the Git Stewards with their Workshops.
Specifically for my workshop, Ben’s feedback on my slides and dry run provided
invaluable feedback that let the ‘real’ workshop go smoothly.</p>

    <p>“Whoever he works with will be grateful to have his skills.”</p>
  </li>
  <li>“I see Ben’s excellent organization, communication, and driven effort on
display almost every day. I believe Ben is a cut above and doing nearly all
the right things to redirect some of the organization’s issues. I hope he
stays the course and keeps pushing in the way he is.”</li>
  <li>“You talk like a grad student”—<a href="https://users.cs.utah.edu/~mflatt/">Matthew Flatt</a></li>
  <li>“Ben is extremely actively with the Customer Support team and threads. He
reaches out directly in situations that require immediate attention or to
clarify a point. Ben shares information with the team and provides perspective
on active tickets. A staple of the team.”</li>
  <li>“Ben always provides timely and well-explained ideas, solutions, and updates.
I feel that Ben’s knowledge, willingness to collaborate, ability to share his
expertise, and his consideration of everyone’s opinions makes him an excellent
teammate and very easy to work with.”</li>
  <li>“One thing that stands out is the level of intellectual rigor Ben brings to
technical discussions. Ben digs deep into problems, asks smart questions, and
offers thoughtful solutions that show a solid understanding of both the
details and the bigger picture.”</li>
  <li>“Ben has established himself as the subject matter expert when it comes to all
things Git! Your knowledge and willingness to help/guide others has been a
strong asset to the broader team!”</li>
  <li>“Ben’s communication skills have been exceptional when it comes to working
through incidents. He’s done a great job coordinating investigations and
post-incident reviews—keeping things clear, organized, and moving forward
even in high-pressure situations.”</li>
  <li>“Ben’s PRs are incredibly clean! He contributes small PRs which are able to be
reviewed quicker and more effectively, thereby ensuring that contributions are
merged in as quickly as possible and that reviewers are able to very easily
understand the changes. His PRs are well documented, and when he makes changes
based on feedback to PRs he proactively and clearly communicates with the
reviewers.”</li>
  <li>“Ben has been a great champion for PR cleanliness and clear commit messages.
When he reviews PRs he’s able to effectively coach other engineers around the
importance of clear commit messages, thereby sharing the knowledge and
positively impacting the broader org. He’s able to do so while ensuring that
high priority changes are not blocked.”</li>
  <li>“Ben works proactively to ensure that items impacting broader teams are
handled in a timely fashion. One example is when a deprecation notice came up
[…] which wasn’t due for several months, Ben started a conversation around
that on Slack to promote visibility and worked to remediate the issue as soon
as he saw it.”</li>
  <li>
    <p>“Ben is a reliable and communicative leader for the [internal Git] community.
In particular he does an excellent job of balancing structure with
flexibility. He provides enough guidance, communication, and logistical
organization (<em>i.e.</em>, scheduling meetings, handling documentation via GitHub,
recruiting workshop leads) for the community to sustain itself but allows each
participant the freedom to participate in whatever way and to whatever degree
they desire. He has actively sought feedback from members of the community and
has adjusted programming accordingly, such as adjusting meeting frequency and
workshop content.</p>

    <p>“This balance was also reflected in his support of my workshop on the use of
  <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git log</code>. He proactively checked in to see if I needed any assistance
  several times throughout the lead up to the workshop and provided advice
  when asked, but ultimately left all decisions up to me, and I never felt any
  pressure from him with regards to how much progress I had made or how to
  design the workshop. Finally, during the workshop he was an active
  participant and enabled others to participate as well.”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“Ben’s greatest virtue is his genuine approach to mentorship. Each session, it
feels like I am gaining valuable information that reveals the true and honest
nature of engineering at Capital One. This has always been what makes me
respect a person and mentor, and Ben has it in spades. Some key takeaways I
have implemented in my own work are:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>“Research before coding. In one of our discussions, we talked about how
useful it is to write down notes and do research before launching into a
solution. When I follow this principle closely, my work comes out much
cleaner and ironically faster despite spending less time coding.</li>
      <li>“Networking. Ben did a great job showing how networking can be engaging and
down-to-earth, instead of an awkward exercise. This made it a lot easier
to expand my influence in my org.</li>
      <li>“Performance management. Ben did a great job outlining the realities and
strategy of performance management, especially when it came to noting
one’s accomplishments over time in a system of record.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>“To this end, Ben is a master-class in effective influence and a living
  example of Capital One values.”</p>
  </li>
  <li>“After working with Ben for the last few months, I can confidently say that
Ben has supported my growth as an engineer. I would try to model off of Ben
for many soft skills like documentation and communications with peers. Ben has
great practices for GitHub and Slack and I learn a lot from just observing
him. His peer reviews are valuable, often pointing out areas of improvements
in a direct and educational manner.”</li>
  <li>“His approach to ramping up—asking precise questions in the broader Slack
channel—helped foster open technical dialogue and increased much-needed
visibility across our landscape issues within the codebases.”</li>
  <li>“From a technical leadership perspective, he quickly became a strong voice for
engineering excellence. He championed best practices, contributed high-quality
code, and introduced improvements to Git workflows and our code quality
tooling […]. His org-wide contributions […] helped elevate the engineering bar
across the team.”</li>
  <li>“Ben joined our team for two sprints as part of a data migration initiative,
where he was tasked with designing an automated data sync validation solution.
He required virtually no ramp-up time and delivered an elegant, comprehensive
solution that leveraged his prior experience effectively. His documentation
stood out—it was not only technically thorough but also structured as a clear,
narrative walkthrough that made it easy for others to engage with and
understand. His documentation also came in handy for broader validation
exercises across the org, as it was referenced by multiple teams for multiple
incidents/deliverables.”</li>
  <li>“Collaboration with him was seamless. He was communicative, engaged, and
thoughtful in his approach.”</li>
  <li>“One of the most talented folks I know at the company.”</li>
  <li>“Radiates a positive attitude like few people I know.”</li>
  <li>“Ben stood out by being able to engage on so many different topics at the same
time.”</li>
  <li>“Ben’s feedback was crucial for delivering high quality code that would be
easily maintainable for his team when they took over the service. I appreciate
his comments on the deprecation of an internal library, which identified
opportunities for a minor performance improvement and better documentation.
Ben also contributed to the removal of a deprecated internal tool from the
service, during which we had a discussion of the efficacy of the new
formatting hooks and he made adjustments based on the feedback I provided. He
went above and beyond the expectation to simply remove the dependency by
providing tools for developers to continue delivering well-written code.”</li>
  <li>
    <p>“Ben clearly and concisely explains Git concepts and practices in a manner
accessible to people with all levels of experience. He actively fields
questions and topics for discussion from attendees, and when addressing them
frames the content in a manner tailored to the asker.</p>

    <p>“Ben’s knowledge of Git and version control in general is extensive. He is
  usually able to answer any questions off the top of his head along with an
  explanation of the history or reasoning behind a concept. When he does not
  know an answer he knows where to look, such as when he quickly found and
  explained the relevant Git source code for a question I asked regarding
  Git’s status output formats.</p>

    <p>“Ben’s ability to explain complex concepts (such as Git’s underlying data
  structures) in an easy to understand manner also speaks to his understanding
  of the domain. I have taken lessons from his material back to my team and
  can confidently say that we produce higher quality code with greater
  confidence as a result of Ben’s instruction on Git workflows, commit best
  practices, merge conflict resolution, and more.”</p>
  </li>
  <li>“Ben is able to bring together a diverse audience into a conversation rather
than just regurgitate information from slides. Helping facilitate different
viewpoints will really assist Ben as he moves forward in his career.”</li>
  <li>“Ben’s communication style is effective, pragmatic, and fact-based. He is able
to communicate in an easy-to-understand way for the technical and developer
experience areas I have witnessed him in. I pulled Ben into discussions around
Engineering Integrity with Distinguished Engineers knowing that he would be
able to help craft a message for all audiences.”</li>
  <li>“The next <a href="https://github.com/wrslatz">Will Slattum</a>”</li>
  <li>“Ben models working across silos by the level of his involvement with the
innersource community. Known in the top 10 active participants, Ben is sought
out as various topics and working group arise. We need more ‘Ben’s in the
community to get the innersource flywheel spinning faster.”</li>
  <li>“Ben’s work educating our developers on Git is outstanding and sets an example
for how engineers can own how they work and contribute back in a meaningful
way.”</li>
  <li>“Ben shows up where most engineers back away from the opportunity. Partnering
with central teams to provide feedback and then ‘do the work’, contributing
directly, builds his credibility and sets him apart from many other engineers.”</li>
  <li>“Ben speaks with the right level of technical depth and context, tailoring his
communication well working with Director+, senior associates, tech or product,
etc.”</li>
  <li>“We depend on contributors like Ben with deep expertise in innersource, a
language, or development practices to drive improvements that benefit
engineers across the entire enterprise. Ben has quickly become one of the most
influential external contributors.”</li>
  <li>“I am excited to work with Ben: he is a great teacher and sets an amazing
example for the platform.”</li>
  <li>“Ben showed me some new tools and techniques that enabled me to write cleaner,
more intuitive code. He was receptive of feedback when I reviewed his work and
always open to two-way dialogue to work towards the best possible solution. He
gave his full attention whenever we met even though the work was outside his
normal scope.”</li>
  <li>“Provides incredibly thoughtful feedback”</li>
  <li>“Sometimes folks like to sit there and point fingers but not offer to help.
Ben does not fall into this category: he actively partners with others to
call out opportunities, bolster user experience, and add new features.”</li>
  <li>“A pleasure to work with”</li>
  <li>“The first thing I noticed about Ben was his attention to detail and
commitment to producing the highest quality code. Ben is able to get up to
speed on the most complex services and contribute thoughtful comments and
suggestions via PR reviews. He always provides detailed explanations and
background in his PRs, which helps us to learn and to understand the changes
and the thought process behind them.”</li>
  <li>“Always brings a lot of energy to solving problems”</li>
  <li>“Willing to share his deep knowledge of Git”</li>
  <li>“Contributes in a style I wish I saw more of. Not afraid to try something even
if it doesn’t pan out, and it often leads to great things.”</li>
  <li>“Ben goes above and beyond to make Capital One a great place to work.”</li>
  <li>“Ben displays endless generosity, passionate and effective communication, and
remarkable influence.”</li>
  <li>“One of the best engineers on the platform”</li>
  <li>“I’m impressed by his code quality, attention to detail, critical thinking,
and initiative to improve.”</li>
  <li>“A true servant leader”</li>
  <li>“Ben’s patience and willingness to share knowledge helped me feel like I could
meaningfully contribute right away.”</li>
  <li>“Demonstrated strong ownership and preparation.”</li>
  <li>“Ben was super engaged and always asking the appropriate questions so him and
his team can fully support these [projects] moving forward. He catches on
quickly […] Ben is very knowledgeable, professional, and is very easy to work
with and I look forward to working with him in the future.”</li>
  <li>“When automating AWS DMS task failover was identified as an opportunity to
reduce RTO, Ben readily collaborated to assess options and develop an
effective near-term solution.”</li>
  <li>“Ben asked clarifying questions when appropriate, identified and documented
multiple issues and their resolutions, and consistently shared these lessons
with the rest of his team to improve their understanding.”</li>
  <li>“I’m confident in Ben’s ability to manage [recovery] smoothly, but more
importantly, his efforts to train the rest of his team on the details extends
my confidence to the rest of his team.”</li>
  <li>“[Ben is] the Git expert around here!”</li>
  <li>“Communicative and responsive […] I felt completely supported and heard.”</li>
  <li>“Effective and generous”</li>
  <li>“Delivered quality solutions, identified gaps and weak points, brought great
ideas to improve our tools and solve issues”</li>
  <li>“Maintained clear and frequent communication”</li>
  <li>“Proactive on code and design review”</li>
  <li>“Able to juggle multiple complex projects”</li>
  <li>“If Ben is on the call, it goes much smoother. He helps his team absorb new
information.”</li>
  <li>“Ben is a good example [of] how to take ownership of tasks.”</li>
  <li>“Ben has an exemplary personality and tremendous knowledge anyone can learn
from.”</li>
  <li>“I remembered Ben from my internship—he was always jumping around in Slack
and helping folks out.”</li>
  <li>“Ben is very focused on ensuring that his designs and his code meets or
exceeds requirements, meet high indicators for quality, and seamlessly
integrate with the application architecture.”</li>
  <li>“Ben readily offers his help to work inside and outside his workspace and
steps in to lend his expertise and bandwidth.”</li>
  <li>“[Ben] actively contributes to design sessions and brings innovative ideas for
forward thinking designs that automate and simplify platform engineering and
make it easier for platform administrators to perform administrative tasks.”</li>
  <li>“[Ben] has been able to deliver very strongly on results, [and] used his
expertise to encourage adoption of proposed ideas.”</li>
  <li>“[Ben is] diligent and open to learn [and is] an impressive addition to the
team.”</li>
  <li>
    <p>“I worked with Ben remotely. He was an intern in the infrastructure team at
Nuage Networks. Being on the infra team meant exposure to the ‘full-stack’ our
systems at Nuage; from racking, stacking, and cabling in the lab, tracing and
debugging virtualization and networking issues, and improving reliability of
different aspects of the CI/CD pipeline.</p>

    <p>“During the interview process it was clear Ben was a bright developer.
  During his first few weeks, he was able to reduce the build time of one of
  the components most built by half (from 20 minutes to 10 minutes).</p>

    <p>“Later on, he built a general purpose caching system for improving the speed
  of some of a more convoluted build process.</p>

    <p>“He is a master of git, and was willing to tutor and mentor those who needed
  help. His communication skills were of the highest quality, in chat, by
  phone, video, and documentation of proposed projects and in code.</p>

    <p>“His ability to dive into and work on ‘legacy’ codebases was impressive and
  admirable. He quickly became the person sought after for code reviews
  because of his sharp insight and intuition.</p>

    <p>“I feel very happy to have worked with Ben. And I am very happy to have the
  chance to recommend him for all the great work he has done.” (John Naulty
  via LinkedIn)</p>
