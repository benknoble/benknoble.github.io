      <h1>Testimonials</h1>
      <ul>
  <li>“The next <a href="https://github.com/wrslatz">Will Slattum</a>”</li>
  <li>“Ben models working across silos by the level of his involvement with the
innersource community. Known in the top 10 active participants, Ben is sought
out as various topics and working group arise. We need more ‘Ben’s in the
community to get the innersource flywheel spinning faster.”</li>
  <li>“Ben’s work educating our developers on Git is outstanding and sets an example
for how engineers can own how they work and contribute back in a meaningful
way.”</li>
  <li>“Ben shows up where most engineers back away from the opportunity. Partnering
with central teams to provide feedback and then ‘do the work’, contributing
directly, builds his credibility and sets him apart from many other engineers.”</li>
  <li>“Ben speaks with the right level of technical depth and context, tailoring his
communication well working with Director+, senior associates, tech or product,
etc.”</li>
  <li>“We depend on contributors like Ben with deep expertise in innersource, a
language, or development practices to drive improvements that benefit
engineers across the entire enterprise. Ben has quickly become one of the most
influential external contributors.”</li>
  <li>“I am excited to work with Ben: he is a great teacher and sets an amazing
example for the platform.”</li>
  <li>“Ben showed me some new tools and techniques that enabled me to write cleaner,
more intuitive code. He was receptive of feedback when I reviewed his work and
always open to two-way dialogue to work towards the best possible solution. He
gave his full attention whenever we met even though the work was outside his
normal scope.”</li>
  <li>“Provides incredibly thoughtful feedback”</li>
  <li>“Sometimes folks like to sit there and point fingers but not offer to help.
Ben does not fall into this category: he actively partners with others to
call out opportunities, bolster user experience, and add new features.”</li>
  <li>“A pleasure to work with”</li>
  <li>“The first thing I noticed about Ben was his attention to detail and
commitment to producing the highest quality code. Ben is able to get up to
speed on the most complex services and contribute thoughtful comments and
suggestions via PR reviews. He always provides detailed explanations and
background in his PRs, which helps us to learn and to understand the changes
and the thought process behind them.”</li>
  <li>“Always brings a lot of energy to solving problems”</li>
  <li>“Willing to share his deep knowledge of Git”</li>
  <li>“Contributes in a style I wish I saw more of. Not afraid to try something even
if it doesn’t pan out, and it often leads to great things.”</li>
  <li>“Ben goes above and beyond to make Capital One a great place to work.”</li>

remarkable influence.”</li>

meaningfully contribute right away.”</li>

with and I look forward to working with him in the future.”</li>
  <li>“When automating AWS DMS task failover was identified as an opportunity to
reduce RTO, Ben readily collaborated to assess options and develop an
effective near-term solution.”</li>
  <li>“Ben asked clarifying questions when appropriate, identified and documented
multiple issues and their resolutions, and consistently shared these lessons
with the rest of his team to improve their understanding.”</li>
  <li>“I’m confident in Ben’s ability to manage [recovery] smoothly, but more
importantly, his efforts to train the rest of his team on the details extends
my confidence to the rest of his team.”</li>
  <li>“[Ben is] the Git expert around here!”</li>
  <li>“Communicative and responsive […] I felt completely supported and heard.”</li>
